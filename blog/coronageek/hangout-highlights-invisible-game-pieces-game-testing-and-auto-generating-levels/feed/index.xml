		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys!

I just started my &quot;programming life&quot;. Was programming back when i was a kid and remembered i loved it! Now 30 ish years later finally got some time to spent programming.
Your show is to hard for me to understand atm, hopefully i will gather more experiance and can enjoy the show more. But for now im that guy applauding the fotballgame only because the other people applauds :)

I can bring a sprite to life and activate the sprite animation when pressing a button. I can take the animation and move it back and forth on the ground with applied physics. I have gone through alot of tutorials! 

so, questions - in generall!
Have you done a show about:
adressing the total noobs? 
Tricks of the trade?
Recomended game rescourses online 

Specific question.
I want to take my sprite and move it on the ground. Then when the sprite is say 100 pxls from the right hand side i want to start scrolling the ground and thus moving the world.]]></description>
