		<description><![CDATA[Charles, I read the post, and I actually think it *is* an elegant solution. I&#039;ve done worse, much worse :) I&#039;d love to get in touch with further details on the book.
Alex,
Definitely planning to showcase. We submitted the app Wednesday for iOS and am in the process of submitting to Amazon, just adding final touches. I&#039;ll tweet you the details]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jorge. Definitely send me details about your storybook as well. I&#039;d be interested in hearing your story. Did you see Christopher Ward&#039;s recent post on the Touch vs Tap event issue? http://coronageek.com/1162/handling-corona-sdk-tap-events-vs-touch-events/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great episode. Kwik is indeed a great tool. Used it for my latest interactive book app. Keep &#039;em coming! Btw, I ran into the &quot;tap&quot; &quot;touch&quot; event listener &quot;feature&quot; as well. My fix was to change tap to touch and check for event.phase == &quot;began&quot;, and ignore &quot;ended&quot; in the callback function. Worked a treat.]]></description>
