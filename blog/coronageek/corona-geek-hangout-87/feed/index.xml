		<description><![CDATA[I agree that PreApps services are probably worth twice what they charge (compare to other providers) I was mostly worried that most here will be not be able to take advantage of them (and so use only the free part) because we simply could not afford them. That&#039;s all.

Yes, I too would love more examples of what can be done with Coronium!

Cheers.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Mo. Both Sean Casto and Chris Byerly are doing amazing things in both spaces. Regarding pricing, have you found a service that costs less than PreApps? My experience has been that other services are more expensive. Regarding Coronium, I would love to see mobile, cloud, and hardware combined into a clean example. It seems like the perfect convergance of technologies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[GREAT show! I am very sorry I could not join until the last minute! I have couple question/comment if I may:

1- @PreApps: LOVE the service!! Thank you for making it possible for small indies like us to get more coverage) I do understand  why you need to make money but could those extra services be a little bit less stiff? For instance $249 for an icon? Do not get me wrong an icon is CRITICAL but unfortunately most of us will not see a $249 for an app (maybe over a year or something) Same thing about the other services like videos trailers... In any event, I really think that a more indie friendly pricing of the extra service will help people like us. Maybe some kind of mix of fixed cost + revenue share?

2- @Coronium: GREAT presentation and examples! I see that the show talks about being able to upload images to the cloud. Any corresponding command for downloading the same image from the same cloud. For instance, I was wondering if it will be possible to download images from an app to make a photo based game?  Also, I will love to know about what can be done with Coronium?  I am still figuring out what kind of other uses is possible.

Great show Charles as usual!
