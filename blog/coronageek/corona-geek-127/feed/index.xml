		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ali,

Great suggestion. The Hangouts are being split into shorter clips. We&#039;ll try to give them specific names when possible. Check out all the clips from 2015 so far and let us know where we can improve, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQUSbLhyMnAoowbZ2n0gvpZje24TbL4UE]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These videos are very nice and helpfull.

BUT
If you can cut the long video to pieces of 2 or 5 minutes, it will be better. And each new video will be given a separated title. Such as &quot;Colored picker&quot; and it&#039;s just like 4m duration and so on.

You will help us to reach what do we need directly and quickly.

Thanks]]></description>

Cool idea! I though about that, but I thought that capturing always used the screen resolution - apparently not! Sweet! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Thomas.

What you could do is load a few of them at a time and put them into their appropriate positions, reporting progress as you go. After that, you capture the current version of the image (initially blank) plus those few images, then dispose of those. Gradually, you&#039;ll build up your master image. Obviously, you construct your sprite sheet table at the same time.

It&#039;s still subject to the load times of the constituent 64 x 64 images, of course, but those shouldn&#039;t be so bad.

I have something like that which I use to edit individual pixels, though the ideas shouldn&#039;t be too different: https://github.com/ggcrunchy/corona_ui/blob/master/widgets/bitmap.lua#L411

(Somewhat relevant to this, I didn&#039;t even know before the show that you could capture things behind other objects! That will come in handy.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would be cool if we could set a sort of chunk size when loading an image, and get an event each time a chunk is loaded.

Alternatively, I could split my images into 64 smaller ones if I could stitch it together later on, and have my progress Ring update each time one of the small images is loaded. Corona staff, would something like this be possible?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
i have written a very challenging, hard to master, unique and entertaining casual game called &quot;Cut-Fall-Crush&quot;. It would be a great game for the Corona Geek. Please have a look.
