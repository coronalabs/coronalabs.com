		<description><![CDATA[Ricardo,

Looks nice! I still use Director, as well as Storyboard. Is this exporting with the Director module?

Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Mo,

Thanks for your help, I&#039;m thinking of a way to talk to people without they think it&#039;s an error of the app and it is a work around.

Today I will put at Game Coder website the roadmap so you guys can see what we are doing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My appology Ricardo! I just found out that my iPad had only 1 Gb memory left. Once I cleaned a little bit (need to clean it more) and got 1.5 Gb then Game Coder opened and just fun. I am very sorry for the false alert. You may want put a warning about checking for memory level in your current iTunes to avoid bad reviews from people. The app is fantastic and you do not want people the wrong first impression especially when it is not the app fault!

Just a suggestion. But anyway it is a GREAT app so far and I am happy that I will be able to play with on the plane tomorrow. No laptop needed!

THANK YOU!

Mo.

Ps: I will leave (good) review shortly]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Ricardo,

I went ahead and purchased hoping to use on a flight tomorrow afternoon to prototype some games with it. Unfortunately it seems to crash at loading. The app says loading and then after maybe 30-40 secs it just quit. I tried killing all the other apps  to make more space but the same thing happened. 

By the way it on ipad2 -32 Gb- iOS 6.0

Any ideas/suggestions?

Thanks a lot.

Mo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[EXCELLENT news! I am going to buy it to make fast game prototypes. It is also the LEAST I can do to support you and all you have done for this community. Can&#039;t wait to see what you have cooking for the new version.

THANKS
