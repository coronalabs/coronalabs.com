		<description><![CDATA[This was packed full of great stuff! The rotation transition code is something I&#039;ve been looking for for a while. I wanted to create a camera that would orbit the main character of my game, but I could only get a rigid square as well. I&#039;ll definitely be trying out your code. Thank you!

Excited about using Coronium too, I had no idea it could be so simple to add cloud based functionality. I did have a quick question though...  Chris mentioned broadcasting can be used for chat, could it also be used to broadcast coordinates or moves of users to all players on a multiplayer game or would that be too server intensive?]]></description>
