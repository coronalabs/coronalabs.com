		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

just want to share my experience with Amazon regarding the Fire Phone:

On my latest binary update for &quot;Freeze!&quot; I just checked the Fire-Phone checkbox, and a few days later I got the result that the update passed all tests, including the Fire Phone - this means &quot;Freeze!&quot; will be available for Fire users from day one.

&quot;Freeze!&quot; additionally would be able to receive all the nice &quot;Developer Select&quot; opportunities if the game would support Amazon Game Circle (the game supports Game Center on iOS and Google Play Games Leaderboards &#038; Achievements, so Game Circle would be easy for me to set up). 

But Corona does not support Game Circle. :-(

But I hope that someday soon Game Circle will be brought into the Corona Mothership, from Corona Labs or from a 3rd party plugin supplier (yes, I of course would pay for it).

Best,
Andreas]]></description>
