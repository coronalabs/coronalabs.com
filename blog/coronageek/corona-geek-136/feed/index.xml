		<description><![CDATA[first off, thanks for this really cool sharing of info! I&#039;m adapting the memory game you made, and although it works perfectly and builds successfully, I&#039;m getting: ERROR: The resource file (ssk/interfaces) could not be found at case-sensitive path (/
and WARNING: Cannot create path for resource file &#039;ssk/interfaces&#039;. File does not exist.
for pretty much every folder in the ask folder whenever the game starts up (on Command R for example). I tested it with your original standalone, and I get the same errors. I tried moving the folder, and the new path doesn&#039;t help. 
the game even works if I capitalize SSK although it generates more error messages. I tried repairing Permissions on my Mac also.
this is the complete path, and the folder is on the desktop with all folders intact from your standalone: ERROR: The resource file (ssk/extensions) could not be found at case-sensitive path (/Users/mikelly321/Desktop/StewSTEM/ssk/extensions). curious if the happens when you load your game in. thanks again!]]></description>
