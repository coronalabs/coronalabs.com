		<description><![CDATA[Yes I appologize, it was my laptop. I should have had a microphone!

 I was talking about a Facebook review group  that was setup last year to help provide app reviews to each other. As you know you need at least 5 reviews every time you launch an app or update your app. Once you join the group, you can post your app link and most of the time you will get those 5 reviews pretty quickly. Considere that a little boost. Obviously the members expect that you will return the favor when asked. Still those reviews need to be fair. If you think the app is worth 3 stars or less then the best thing to do  is to contact the developer directly and provide some direct feedback.  We can do, ios, Android, nook and kindle so you should not  have any  issues no matter the app market. We have around 220 members but we love to have more!

Early last year, I noticed that most apps on the showcase were launching with little or no reviews. I thought it was crazy since the Coronalabs community is so large. That is why I posted the following back then. Just follow the link on the first post and ask to join. Very easy!
