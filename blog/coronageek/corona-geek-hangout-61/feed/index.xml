		<description><![CDATA[Hey Noah, great show today. Thank you answering all the questions I had! For you and people who have problem with the review button in your app, Scott Aldeman provided me this link (Thanks Scott!) where you can generate a direct link to your app in the appstore (IOS) Make sure to select apps in the menu.

http://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/us/

I think you can then use the link and use the same way you did as before (below ios 7)

I am going to update my app that way and see. Right now, it seems that people who try to review my app cannot because the link has changed.

Hope this help.
