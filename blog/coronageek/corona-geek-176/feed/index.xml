		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Bob. I have a strong connection at home and the Perk office has a good connection, so it must be my computer. Perk upgraded me to a new Macbook Pro and I&#039;ve secured a conference room with a wired network connection. We&#039;re definitely working to step up the quality. The only other option would be to use a different streaming service or add a piece of dedicated streaming hardware into the mix.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just played the video and the quality was pretty good. Keep in mind, you&#039;re watching a Google Hangout. The video quality of the presenters is dependent on their Internet upload speeds and in many cases upload speeds are insufficient for video transmission. There is also a chance you saw the video before YouTube finished transcoding the higher definition versions too.

I would suggest going back and re-watching it, factoring in that it&#039;s a Google Hangout video and see if you&#039;re still having quality issues.]]></description>
