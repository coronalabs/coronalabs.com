Thank you for all your hard work. It&#039;s very motivating. I opened up the 7G7D project last night and built the game right off the bat. The code is very well thought out and I particularly enjoy seeing how all the different games are pulled together into one containing app.

@Graham
Yes, thank you and Simon both for organizing this event. It&#039;s awesome to see a member of the community step up to create an event like this where everyone can participate. Keep up the awesome work!

Also, thank you to everyone who watches Corona Geek and subscribes to the podcast. Thank you to the developers who show up every week to be on the panel. None of it would be possible without you. You guys are Corona Geek.

Cheers!]]></description>

Yeah, it was clever when I chose it, but I never actually said it out loud. And it seems a bit too late to change it now. :)

		<description><![CDATA[@Charles, 
Thanks for having me on the show and thanks for putting my video in the blog post!

@Graham, 
Thanks for hosting the GIGJam which gave me the motivation to try the 7G7D warmup.  Also, thank for GGFile (http://bit.ly/14P7ScC) which I used to create level directories in my games.

@The Community
You can get the games as a bundle for Android right now, and hopefully soon on iOS.  Just search for 7G7D in the app store(s), or follow this link:

7G7D on Google Play: http://bit.ly/17uykGo

Lastly, I was going to make these into templates, but for now I&#039;m going to release the code on GumRoad for $0+: https://gumroad.com/l/tbZN

If you would still rather see these as templates, follow the directions in the GumRoad description.  

Thanks!]]></description>
