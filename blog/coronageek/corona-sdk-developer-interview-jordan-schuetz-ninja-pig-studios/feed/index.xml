		<description><![CDATA[@facebook-1497501964:disqus I agree, the Nook In-app purchase limitation was not something I was aware of. With all the talk about freemium&#039;s rise in popularity it&#039;s interesting to see an ecosystem where it&#039;s not an option. I guess we&#039;ll have to wait and see how that plays out for the Nook and the mobile app industry in general. Thank you for watching the interview.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great Interview!  I enjoyed the discussion on Jordan&#039;s experience with the Nook market.  Great points about competition in the marketplace since his entry,  and about B&#038;N&#039;s no-IAP policy and how that affected his options for promotion.]]></description>
