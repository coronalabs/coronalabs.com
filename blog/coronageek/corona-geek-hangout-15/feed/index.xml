		<description><![CDATA[Oh, that&#039;s a *good* question. And when I heard they were revamping the widgets I thought, simultaneously, &quot;Cool!&quot; and &quot;Crap!&quot; I want better widgets, but I hate redoing videos. :)


I typically create my tutorial courses based on the publicly available release, not daily builds. So when a new release happens, if there are changes needed I&#039;ll either add supplementary videos for small changes, or completely recreate the affected videos for larger changes.


Basically, I intend to keep the videos up-to-date (with the current public release).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Warning: drama alert) No, not close. The death of my father and the disappearance of my 16yo daughter this summer basically blew 3 months to smithereens. About a month ago is when I finally got things shifted back into Drive but I&#039;m still playing catch-up.


That&#039;s the biggest downside to being a &quot;lone wolf developer&quot; -- when life happens there&#039;s nobody else who can take up the slack.


Renegade is still on my list, but pushed back because the scope of Outlaw is in flux. While today it&#039;s a rebranded copy of CPM, I&#039;ve come up with some ways to get about halfway to Renegade -- while still allowing it to be used in it&#039;s current form.


Renegade is going to be a complete switch -- if you want to use it, you *won&#039;t* be able to write your program any way you want like you can now with Outlaw/CPM. But what I see Outlaw morphing into over the next 2-3 months is something that allows both methods.


The biggest difference between Outlaw and Renegade is the &quot;new stuff&quot; in Outlaw will be using Corona SDK under the hood -- I still plan on using Moai SDK for Renegade.


Why not just get to work right on Renegade? Because I think at this point the market for a Corona-based tool is bigger than the market for a Moai-based tool. And I have to pay the bills. My &quot;funding&quot; for tomorrow comes from whatever sales I make today, basically.


But if someone threw q big bunch of money at me? I&#039;d dump everything and focus on Renegade. In a heartbeat.


Sorry, I know that was a long answer. :)]]></description>
