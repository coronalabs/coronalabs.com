		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stian,

Thanks for the clarification. I hope you&#039;ll let everyone know when the rendering is corrected. I&#039;m considering subscribing with the intent of reading the magazine on my iPad.

Cheers! Ken

PS: Just saw part of the interview on Corona Geek where you say you&#039;re an audio guy. Me too though I do visual effects for a living. I&#039;ve got Figure on my iPhone :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Ken. 
We are aware of the rendering problem and believe us, we&#039;re working very hard to fix it. We&#039;re currently not available on the App-Store. The app-store button you are referring to is at Joomag&#039;s (our publishing platform) site and is, or should be, linking to their magazine reader app. We&#039;re sorry about the confusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

The CoronaPaper publication seems pretty interesting but when I went to view the sample in Safari on my iPad, unlike on my MacBook Pro, the content (including text) didn&#039;t seem to resize properly rendering the text very poorly when zoomed in. The webpage also as a button suggesting that CoronaPaper is available on the App Store but clicking that link only opens iTunes. Even searching explicitly for CoronaPaper (or variations of that) returns no results. What am I missing here?

Thx!]]></description>
