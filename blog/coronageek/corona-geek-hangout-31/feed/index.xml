		<description><![CDATA[Nice video. Thank you for the tips. 

At first, I didn&#039;t know how to use video to effectively promote an app, but with this post, I learned how to increase app exposure (and hopefully - sales).

I&#039;ll definitely bookmark this post and probably watch the video again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Alex. It was great to talk with you at SXSW and to see all the people at the Mindgrub Games booth. Thank you for the great t-shirt. Next time I wear it on the show, I&#039;ll try to get more of the design in the video :)

Let me know when we can get you guys on a hangout. We&#039;d love to hear your developer story.]]></description>
