		<description><![CDATA[@Nick - Actually, Nintendo stated that they had nothing to do with the removal.  I&#039;m sorry to hear you&#039;re having some issues with them.  Good luck.

		<description><![CDATA[Good observation Nick. It&#039;s very easy to comment from the stand, but I&#039;m sure the developer feels/felt a very real element of stress that just wasn&#039;t desired. Some people would just say, &quot;oh well&quot; and keep moving forward. But, not everyone is built that way. Hope your dealings go smoothly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You guys all missed the point with Flappy Birds. I wish I was in this conversation. Why? This is ironically happening to me right now with two of my apps. It&#039;s stress related! Dealing with lawyers, and Nintendo!]]></description>
