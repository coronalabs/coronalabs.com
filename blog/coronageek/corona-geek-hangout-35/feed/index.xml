		<description><![CDATA[E Johnson and David, thank you both for watching and supporting the show. Brian did a great job telling his developer story. He also shared some great tips. It&#039;s inspiring to hear the creativity of others. My favorite part was when he talked about giving the app away for free as a marketing tool to attract customers to his online subscription service. That&#039;s a really smart idea. Maybe we can get Brian back on once he&#039;s had a chance to get the subscription piece completed.]]></description>
