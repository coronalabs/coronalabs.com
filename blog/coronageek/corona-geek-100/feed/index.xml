		<description><![CDATA[100 shows!!! CONGRATS Charles! Along with the  the forum, this  show is the BEST  part of Corona!!! Please keep up coming!

Also, great conversation about Admob! I wish I there:) Unfortutely I am working on a project and Mondays (and the rest of the week work!) do not allow me to be present. Thanks God for these recordings.

@Sergey, did you by any chance compare admob and Chartboost full screens ads? In term of eCPM.

Thanks a again Charles for all you work and hope to be able to join before you reach show 200!
