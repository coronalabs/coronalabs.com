		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Ed&#039;s view on the bundle thing.
When i first heard about it and how it was reported as positively received- first thing to come to mind was a quote from &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

Falco: You really think people are going to be seduced by that? 
Gracchus: I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they&#039;ll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they&#039;ll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate, it&#039;s the sand of the coliseum. He&#039;ll bring them death - and they will love him for it.

It&#039;s quite a complicated scenario - and you should consider a more in-depth discussion on the topic.]]></description>
