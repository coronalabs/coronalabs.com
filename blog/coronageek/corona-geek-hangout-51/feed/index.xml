		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree. Andrea Zanetti is an inspiration. The fact that he taught himself to program, draw cartoons, and game design is amazing. I love that he started learning to program at 10 because he wanted to build a website devoted to a game console. It&#039;s those moments when a hobby turns into a life long skill.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to Andrea Zanetti&#039;s Ice Hero.  I enjoyed his interview and was impressed not only with his independent application design and works but also with his command of the English language at such young age.  His calm demeanor and humility is beyond his age.  Not playing down the first part of the program on OUYA and other topics, just would like to add that Andrea&#039;s interview begins at around 32:00 mark of this current video.]]></description>
