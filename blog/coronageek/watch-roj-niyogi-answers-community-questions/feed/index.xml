		<description><![CDATA[I have no problems with the Perk takeover, as Roj says there needs to be a value proposition and he demonstrated the value in Corona.

I have no idea what Fuse&#039;s value proposition was?

I really hope Perk updates the Corona webpage as it has not changed in years and looks stale. 

I would prefer a cheaper enterprise licence as I have dropped back to the free tier and I fee like a leech (but I don&#039;t have any active games anymore in the app stores as this is a hobby for me).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great talk many things to learn.
yeah Corona has big potential, and it&#039;s a big opportunity right there,
I hope Corona got to the right hands, But...

The BIG question,  will there be Conflict of interest? will Perk has internal Corona and public Corona versions?

I hope it will be just the opposite, where Perk already share some of the Corona plugins/addons they already have!

Roj, Can you please answer this?

Thank you,
and Good luck for you, for Corona and for Corona community]]></description>
