		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Marco for listening and supporting the podcast. I will definitely try to speed up the downloads. In terms of show schedule, the weekly show will still be on Monday&#039;s. We are experimenting with when to publish the replay, but the live show will always be at 2pm CST on Monday, until there&#039;s some reason to change. Right now I&#039;m playing catch up, but my plan is to start putting out in-depth video tutorial and app reviews during the week. If you want something specific covered, let me know. If you have comments about the show format, let me know that too. I&#039;m open to experimentation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They could make the MP3 files smaller by making them mono before uploading them. Saves a LOT of MBs and stereo vs mono for voice is a non-issue. (Just make sure you don&#039;t split one side out -- actually convert to mono so the sound comes out of both left and right).

		<description><![CDATA[I always listen to the Hangout during commute, so I&#039;m usually a day or so behind. Anyway, nice work with Corona Geek, I hope the frequency will remain the same, and that more in-depth insights will be discussed as well.

Oh, and that you get a better host for your mp3s, since downloading an episode takes ages. And it&#039;s not my connection :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rob. Thank you for pointing that out. I did not include any of the other Corona Labs staff interviews as well. Mohamed Hamedi is the only interviewee that could be technically considered a staff interview, but since we were discussing the service on the day of it&#039;s announced acquisition, it only seemed reasonable to include it. It&#039;s great to have the Corona Labs staff on the show, but they are really not the focus. They are a very important part of creating the best product possible, but the spirit of the show is to provide a virtual &quot;show and tell&quot; space where developers can share their experiences and talk about their work. You are right, Peach&#039;s video has received a lot of views and I did not take it down once she was no longer with the company because I understand that she is well liked and I thought people would like to have the chance to hear her story. I apologize if I&#039;ve offended anyone. That was certainly not my intention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You forgot your interview with Peach from October in both your video and your blog. Kind of surprising since it has over twice the views any of your other videos have. It&#039;s easily the best thing on your youtube. Here&#039;s the link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6N4oaFRT64]]></description>
