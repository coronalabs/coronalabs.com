				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges in building successful games comes down to one simple, but hard to answer question: Is it fun? We all need to know that answer. Compounding the problem is the fact that what you might find as fun, someone else may not enjoy.</p>
<p>In <a href=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JoostVanDongen/20180904/325770/The_challenge_of_finding_enough_playtesters.php target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog post</a> by Joost van Dongen, a lead programmer and co-founder of<a href=http://www.ronimo-games.com/ target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ronimo Games</a>, talks about how they go about finding playtesters for their games. He also discusses the differences between QA (Quality Assurance) and playtesting.</p>
<p>Fun games lead to more successful games. How do you find playtesters? Let&#8217;s discuss playtesting further in the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/73771-from-the-blog-finding-playtesters-for-your-game/ target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corona community forums</a>!</p>

<p>Corona is of course popular for making 2D games. But it takes more than a great engine and a great idea to be successful. There is a lot that&#8217;s needed to bring that great idea to a complete product that will be well received by your audience.</p>
<p>In this <a href=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RichardAtlas/20180722/322637/Is_Anything_More_Important_Than_a_Games_Consistency.php target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post on Gamasutra</a>, <a href=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/author/RichardAtlas/995937/ target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Atlas</a>, dives into the concept of consistency. Consistency comes in many forms from marketing consistency to the expectations of genre pieces.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of this advice will help you make the next rockstar game that brings you fame and fortune.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Color &#8212; or even a lack of color &#8212; impacts every game ever created. Color is one of the primary emotional cues a designer can use to set the mood of a game and thus the player. In fact, understanding how to use color properly could be the difference between a hit app or one that gets almost no downloads.</p>
<p>In this roundup, let&#8217;s look at several resources which discuss the topic of color in game design.</p>

			<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.</p>
