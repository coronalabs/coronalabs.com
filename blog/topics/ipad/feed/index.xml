				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting in Corona SDK build <strong>2015.2542</strong>, local and push notifications have been moved to a plugin. If you&#8217;re using this feature, you will need to update your project’s <code>build.settings</code> file so that the <code>plugins</code> table includes the following:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">settings =
{
    plugins =
    {
        [&quot;plugin.notifications&quot;] =
        {
            publisherId = &quot;com.coronalabs&quot;,
        },
    },
}</pre><p>On Corona Enterprise, there will be plugin binaries available in the plugins zip corresponding to the above daily build.</p>
<h3>iOS Push Permissions Dialog</h3>
<p>One of the benefits of this plugin is to give you more control over the timing of the push notification permissions dialog, an often requested <a href=http://feedback.coronalabs.com/forums/188732-corona-sdk-feature-requests-feedback/suggestions/5881595-control-the-timing-of-allow-push-notifications-p>feature</a>. With this plugin, push notifications on iOS are no longer automatically registered — instead, you must explicitly request for the use of push notifications, prompting iOS to ask for permission:</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">local notifications = require( &quot;plugin.notifications&quot; )
notifications.registerForPushNotifications()</pre><p></p>
<h3>Deprecated APIs</h3>
<p>Since notifications are now a plugin, we are deprecating the following core APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>system.cancelNotification()</code> → <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/plugin/notifications/cancelNotification.html>notifications.cancelNotification()</a></li>
<li><code>system.scheduleNotification()</code> → <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/plugin/notifications/scheduleNotification.html>notifications.scheduleNotification()</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These deprecated APIs will eventually be removed, so we recommend that you migrate your code as soon as possible. For your convenience, we have modified these APIs to call through to the new plugin APIs, but you must still include the notification plugin.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Please refer to the <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/plugin/notifications/index.html>notification documentation</a> for complete details.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time for a quick update on your favorite <a href=/products/corona-sdk/>mobile app development</a> platform.</p>
<p>Last week, Apple announced iOS7 Beta at WWDC. A lot of cool stuff was shown. The interesting thing is that a lot of the &#8220;flat&#8221; UI that was demonstrated was exactly the kind of thing we saw some of you <em><strong>already</strong></em> creating using Corona&#8217;s graphics system.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-36154" alt="Corona iOS 7 Beta device build" src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-17-at-9.04.16-PM-300x171.png" /></p>
<p>For example, <a href=http://foreseetheday.com/>this app</a> was in the works before iOS 7 was even announced!</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s NDA prevents me from talking too much about iOS7, but what I can say is that we will fully support iOS7. In fact, last week, starting in <a href=http://developer.coronalabs.com/release/2013/1141/>daily build</a> 1141, you can try your app out on iOS 7 Beta. On the right, you just select &#8220;7.0 beta&#8221; from the iOS device build dialog in the Corona Simulator, and presto, you&#8217;ve got an app built against the iOS 7 Beta SDK that you can test on your own device.</p>
<p>I really recommend you do try out your apps on iOS 7. If the past is any indication, we expect iOS 7 to introduce regression bugs that affect all iOS developers, not just Corona developers. The sooner you know about them, the less you&#8217;ll be surprised when iOS 7 is finally released!</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-36163" alt="Corona SDK supports Facebook Connect" src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-17-at-9.25.24-PM.png" /><br />
(Our lawyers will bug me about this, so let me just remind you that if you are using iOS 7 Beta, you must honor Apple&#8217;s developer membership rules.)</p>
<p>We also have upgraded <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/facebook/>Corona&#8217;s Facebook support</a> on Android, so it&#8217;s on par with iOS. Now, you can run Facebook&#8217;s Scrumptious sample on Android just like you can on iOS.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also working on adding Facebook monetization features like <a href=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/tutorials/mobile-app-ads/>Mobile App Install Ads</a> that can help drive more installations of your app and increase discovery, all things that will help you make more money with your app! This should be coming in a daily build later this week.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-36165 alignright" alt="Corona-text-alignment" src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Corona-text-alignment-300x45.png" width="300" height="45" /><br />
There were a bunch of other interesting checkins that you&#8217;ll notice in the <a href=http://developer.coronalabs.com/corona-daily-builds/summary>daily build notes</a> related to gaming, but the one I want to highlight is related to business apps or any app that&#8217;s dealing with lots of text.</p>
<p>In the next daily build, we are going to be giving more text alignment capabilities. You&#8217;ll be able to set left, center, right alignment on multiline text objects, the ones created by &#8216;display.newText()&#8217;. There will be more docs forthcoming on our <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/>daily build API docs</a>. I&#8217;ll update here when they&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The reference for the text alignment is <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/api/library/display/newText.html>here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Word-Hunt-screenshot.jpg" alt="Word Hunt screenshot" class="alignright size-full wp-image-29145" />For adventurous wordsmiths, Word Hunt – Word Search features over 50 categories of words, ranging from sports, to world currencies to Shakespeare. The game provides three levels of difficulty, with harder levels presenting more rows, columns and words to discover. My favorite element of the game was having the ability to build my own Word Hunt list. After creating a &#8220;dogs&#8221; category, I customized my list by adding over a dozen dog breeds that I then uncovered in a maze of letters. </p>

By completing each level quickly and with minimal block movements, you&#8217;ll rack up more points.</p>
<p>Within days of the game&#8217;s release, it&#8217;s received an average 5-star rating on iTunes from emphatic fans.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-28-at-10.34.56-AM.png" alt="Beck and Bo" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-28746" /></p>
<p>Created for toddlers and preschoolers, Beck and Bo encourages curiosity and exploration in youngsters. The app combines entertainment with real learning, bolstering children&#8217;s vocabulary and improving overall dexterity skills as they drag and drop animals, objects and characters within interactive scenes. Already a hit among parents, Beck and Bo landed in the Top 10 of Paid Educational Games on iTunes and was even featured in <a href=http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/gudmundsen/2013/01/18/apps-for-toddlers/1833303>USA Today</a> as one of the best apps for introducing toddlers to digital play.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Beck-and-Bo-screenshot-300x200.jpg" alt="Beck and Bo screenshot" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28747" />Beck and Bo takes your child on an interactive journey through twelve beautifully illustrated environments. Ranging from a zoo environment complete with gorgeous giraffes and elephants, to a beach scene filled with lavish palm trees and soothing waves, each scene comes to life before your eyes and provides an immersive learning experience. As objects float down the screen, children are encouraged to drag and drop them to their appropriate spot to complete a scene. Once an object is placed in its correct location, the app announces the image&#8217;s name, helping children associate a visual representation with a verbal sound. Visually irresistible, the paper cut-out style illustrations and soothing pastel colors also contribute to a very enjoyable experience. </p>
<p>You can enjoy Beck and Bo for $1.99 on <a href=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beck-and-bo/id557624393?mt=8>iTunes</a> or on the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/react-in-Beck-and-Bo/dp/B009MO89Y4/ref=sr_1_2?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1359402048&sr=1-2&keywords=beck+and+bo>Amazon Appstore</a>.</p>

Of course, your opponents are likely to throw similar objects in your direction. </p>

Fisher&#8217;s) grandparents during World War II. As a poetry lover and history buff, I absolutely loved the compilation of beautiful poems inspired by the original content from the letters. J. A. Fisher also shares 20 blackout poems &#8211; by redacting sections of his grandfather&#8217;s letters, he simulates a poetic War Department Censurer. What We Mean offers a unique, one-of-a-kind experience that you can enjoy from the <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/what-we-mean/id578090540?mt=8>App Store</a>.</p>
