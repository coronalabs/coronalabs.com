				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Color &#8212; or even a lack of color &#8212; impacts every game ever created. Color is one of the primary emotional cues a designer can use to set the mood of a game and thus the player. In fact, understanding how to use color properly could be the difference between a hit app or one that gets almost no downloads.</p>
<p>In this roundup, let&#8217;s look at several resources which discuss the topic of color in game design.</p>
