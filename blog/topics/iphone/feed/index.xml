		<description><![CDATA[Great news! Corona developers can submit to Apple's iTunes Connect again. Read further to get the details.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-58813" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/apple-129x150.jpg" alt="Apple logo" width="100" height="116" />Great news! Corona developers can submit to Apple&#8217;s iTunes Connect again, but doing so requires <a href=https://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/daily-builds/ target="_blank">Daily Build 2016.2948</a> or later.</p>
<p>To better outline the context of this: When Apple enabled iOS 10 submissions following their September 7, 2016 keynote event, one of the updates was additional automatic scanning of files in the app bundle to detect potential issues. With this new process in place, everyone who submitted a Corona Simulator or Corona Enterprise build started getting a failure message from Apple due to problems with &#8220;app thinning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our engineers have been working tirelessly to discover the root cause of the problem and deliver a solution to Corona developers. Essentially, Apple is now scanning files with an extension that they were not previously looking at. Corona&#8217;s products used that extension for our internal files and it suddenly started being flagged as problematic. We have switched to a name-spaced extension that should not cause this issue in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, these fixes are only available in <a href=https://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/daily-builds/ target="_blank">Daily Build 2016.2948</a> and later</strong> &#8212; you will have to update to this build in order to submit your apps to Apple.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who reported issues and provided additional details. Your assistance and patience is truly appreciated!</p>

Starting in daily build 2015.2560, we are giving you the ability to create <a href="http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/guide/graphics/customEffects.html">custom shader effects</a>.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Update]: Some really cool shaders being shared in the forums <a href=http://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/56284-share-your-shaders/>here</a> and <a href=http://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/56212-corona-shader-playground-from-your-web-browser/?p=290925>here</a>.</p>
<p>One of Corona&#8217;s <a href=/blog/2015/01/30/state-of-corona-thoughts-and-reflections-2015/>major themes</a> for this year was graphics, and in particular, giving you more &#8220;under the hood&#8221; access to our graphics engine.</p>
<h2>Fragment/Vertex Kernels</h2>
<p>Starting in daily build 2015.2560, we are giving you the ability to create <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/guide/graphics/customEffects.html>custom shader effects</a>. If you&#8217;re familiar with writing shaders in GLSL-ES, then you&#8217;ll feel right at home writing shaders in Corona.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve structured things so you don&#8217;t need to write a full shader program. Instead, you write snippets of GLSL-ES shader code that we call kernels. Instead of a full vertex shader program, you write a vertex kernel; instead of a full fragment shader program, you write a fragment kernel.</p>
<p>This way, you can focus on creating and implementing cool visual effects without worrying about the surrounding scaffolding. In fact, we&#8217;ve used this same exact system for all the <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/guide/graphics/effects.html>built-in shader effects</a> in Corona.</p>
<h2>Web-based Shader Playground</h2>
<p>To make this even easier, we&#8217;ve created a <a href=https://shader.coronalabs.com/>Corona Shader Playground</a> where you can play/experiment with Corona custom (fragment) shaders right from your browser!</p>
<p>(NOTE: WebGL is required to see the preview. If your browser doesn&#8217;t have proper support, you will only see code, no preview.)</p>
<p>Below are some live examples of fragment kernels that you can edit (just click in the code box). The inlined examples we have here are just a partial view into what the playground lets you do — click &#8220;Open in Playground&#8221; and you&#8217;ll get the full experience such as varying parameters, changing textures, etc.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a basic &#8220;Hello World&#8221; fragment shader (WebGL support is required in your browser):</p>
<div class="shaderCodeAndCanvas" data-vertex="[0.9,0,0,0]" data-shader-file="shaders/color.frag"></div>
<p>Fragment kernel functions are called for every single pixel to determine the color to &#8220;shade&#8221; the pixel. In the above example, the shader always returns red which is why the entire shape gets colored red. As the comment suggests, try modifying the above code to use a different color and live preview the results.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a slightly more complex shader:</p>
<div class="shaderCodeAndCanvas" data-vertex="[0.9,0,0,0]" data-shader-file="shaders/simple.frag"></div>
<p>This example achieves its effect by mapping texture coordinate values to the the &#8220;Red&#8221; and &#8220;Green&#8221; channels and using time to vary the &#8220;Blue&#8221; channel.</p>
<p>Both of these fragment kernels are examples of generators, because they procedurally generate the texture (no source image textures are used).</p>
<p>There are more complex shader effect examples in the playground like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href=https://shader.coronalabs.com/?#shaders/plasma.frag&[16,16,0.0,0.0]>plasma generator</a></li>
<li>a <a href=https://shader.coronalabs.com/?#shaders/bulge.frag&textures/512/checkerboard-diffuse.jpg&[0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0]>bulge image filter</a></li>
<li>a <a href=https://shader.coronalabs.com/?#shaders/moon.frag&textures/512/moon-diffuse.jpg&%5B0.005,0.01,-0.3,1.5%5D>rotating moon effect</a> (Lua means &#8220;moon&#8221; in Portuguese).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>ERROR ITMS-9000: "This bundle is invalid. New apps and app updates submitted to the App Store must be built with public (GM) versions of XCode 5.1.1 or higher and iOS 7 SDK. Do not submit apps built with beta software.”

<p>(BTW, technically, Xcode 5.1 was GM, not beta as the error message suggests, but Apple gets to write the rules&#8230;)</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ve found a way to address this issue. You can now use the last public release (2189) — simply redo your device build and submit. In addition, you can use daily builds 2306 or later, as these have been built with Xcode 5.1.1.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting in <a href=http://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/daily-builds>daily build</a> 2014.2277, we are changing the minimum supported version on iOS from 5.1 to 6. This means that if you do a device build with 2014.2277 (or later), your app will not run on a device whose version is below iOS 6.</p>
<p>This change is needed to move our iOS architecture forward, and finally pay off technical debt that has been accumulating for nearly 18 months — an eternity in the mobile space.</p>
<p>Now that previous iOS versions (3.x, 4.x, 5.x) account has declined to a mere 2% (according to <a href=https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/>Apple</a>), we can no longer justify accumulating this sort of technical debt. It&#8217;s difficult to maintain; it&#8217;s fragile; and it&#8217;s not future-proof — we inevitably had to introduce new hacks.</p>
<p>Back when iOS 6 was released, Apple made fundamental changes to how apps supported multiple orientations. Unfortunately, these changes were not compatible with code designed to work against earlier versions of iOS. </p>
<p>Historically, to maintain support for both older and modern iOS versions, we had to do things that were not true to the modern way of doing things in iOS. This created a conflict in our architecture, one we predicted would generate problems in the future. And we were right — you may recall these unsavory strings in your build.settings:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">CoronaUseIOS6PortraitOnlyWorkaround
CoronaUseIOS6LandscapeOnlyWorkaround
CoronaUseIOS6IPadPhotoPickerLandscapeOnlyWorkaround
CoronaUseIOS7LandscapeOnlyWorkaround
CoronaUseIOS7IPadPhotoPickerLandscapeOnlyWorkaround</pre><p></p>
<p>In the latest daily builds, we have modernized our orientation support, fully embracing the iOS 6 model for orientation support, thus removing the internal architectural conflict. That means we&#8217;ll no longer be able to deal with orientation properly on older iOS versions such as 5.1.</p>
<p>The great thing about these changes are that they completely remove the need for the above hacks. For example, built-in UI like the photo picker and Game Center no longer require the hack. They&#8217;ll also eliminate the need for them in the <em>future</em>, so newer UI that Apple introduces will not need separate hacks. </p>
<p>If you must release on iOS 5.1, we recommend you use an older daily build (prior to 2014.2277) or the last public release. All future daily builds and future releases will require iOS 6.0 or higher.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Enterprise users take note that if you update to the latest daily build: </p>
<p>(1) You should update your Xcode project so that the &#8220;iOS Deployment Target&#8221; is 6.0, as this controls the minimum version.<br />
(2) &#8216;UISupportedInterfaceOrientations&#8217; is now ignored, so if you want to control the orientations that the application (not to be confused with the Corona content) supports, your implementation of the &#8216;CoronaDelegate&#8217; should override &#8216;application:supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow:&#8217;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, I have a lot more daily build goodies to share for your <a href=/products/corona-sdk/>mobile app development</a> pleasure. The following are available as of <a href=http://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/daily-builds>Daily Build</a> 2013.1225.</p>
<h2>Amazon IAP</h2>
<p>First off, Amazon in-app purchases! Our friends at Amazon have created a plugin just for Corona SDK developers. You&#8217;ll be able to sell digital content and subscriptions like in-game currency, expansion packs, upgrades, magazine issues, etc for apps you publish to the Amazon App Store.</p>
<p>For SDK users, your &#8216;build.settings&#8217; should look something like:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">settings =
{
    plugins =
    {
        -- key is the name passed to Lua's 'require()'
        [&quot;plugin.amazon.iap&quot;] =
        {
            -- required
            publisherId = &quot;com.amazon&quot;,
        },
    },      
}</pre><p></p>
<p>And for Enterprise users, download the latest <a href=http://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/enterprise-daily-builds>Enterprise plugins</a> and copy a couple of JAR files.</p>
<p>Check out the full details in the <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/plugin/amazon.iap/index.html>Amazon IAP plugin docs</a>.</p>
<h2>Map Improvements</h2>
<p>Next up is maps. We&#8217;ve added support to detect when map markers have been tapped. And we&#8217;ve also added the ability to set custom images map markers.</p>
<p>These are both accessible via the <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/api/type/Map/addMarker.html>map:addMarker()</a> API:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">local function markerListener(event)
    print( event.type, event.markerId, event.latitude, event.longitude)
end

local options = {
    title = &quot;Displayed Title&quot;, 
    subtitle = &quot;subtitle text&quot;, 
    listener = markerListener, 
    imageFile = &quot;someImage.png&quot;,
}

local myMap = native.newMapView( 20, 20, 300, 220 )
myMap:addMarker( 37.331692, -122.030456, options )</pre><p></p>
<p>You can also remove map markers via a new <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/api/type/Map/removeMarker.html>map:removeMarker()</a> API.</p>
<h2>New Analytics Dashboard</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Corona-Analytics-Dashboard-300x294.png" alt="Corona-Analytics-Dashboard" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-47525" /></p>
<p>LaunchPad analytics are now back online! </p>
<p>You can get stats by going to your <a href=http://developer.coronalabs.com/dashboard>dashboard</a>. When you&#8217;re logged in, you&#8217;ll see a &#8220;Dashboard&#8221; link on the top. </p>
<p>On the dashboard, we&#8217;ve organized all your apps in tabs. You can click on the little &#8216;x&#8217; to hide the apps that you don&#8217;t care about. They&#8217;ll be placed in a &#8220;Hidden Tabs&#8221; section of your dashboard if you want to bring them back.</p>
<p>The great thing about this dashboard is it gives you a lot more useful information than the old analytics dashboard. </p>
<p>Right now, there&#8217;s about a 24-48 hour delay, but our friends at <a href=http://amplitude.com/>Amplitude</a> are working round the clock to bring that down. Part of the reason there&#8217;s such a long delay is because Amplitude&#8217;s servers are overwhelmed by the number of consumers using your apps! </p>
<p>We expect that delay to steadily decrease as Amplitude tunes their system in coming weeks.</p>
<h2>Regressions</h2>
<p>Finally, there were several regression issues that we addressed. I&#8217;ll just highlight two:</p>
<p>One annoying one was in the Transition 2.0 library. There were several issues that got resolved, such as being more forgiving about &#8216;nil&#8217; target objects. We also resolved a race condition when new transitions were created or cancelled from inside a completion listener. This latter issue could occur, for example, if you changed storyboard scenes from inside a completion listener. </p>
<p>The other issue was with multiline text in iOS 7. The issue occurred in which the last line of multiline text didn&#8217;t show. It&#8217;s now fixed.</p>
<p><center>* * *</center></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for now. We&#8217;ve got a few more announcements coming. One of them is about Graphics 2.0, so if you&#8217;re a subscriber, stay tuned!</p>

<p>Last week, Apple announced iOS7 Beta at WWDC. A lot of cool stuff was shown. The interesting thing is that a lot of the &#8220;flat&#8221; UI that was demonstrated was exactly the kind of thing we saw some of you <em><strong>already</strong></em> creating using Corona&#8217;s graphics system.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-36154" alt="Corona iOS 7 Beta device build" src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-17-at-9.04.16-PM-300x171.png" /></p>
<p>For example, <a href=http://foreseetheday.com/>this app</a> was in the works before iOS 7 was even announced!</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s NDA prevents me from talking too much about iOS7, but what I can say is that we will fully support iOS7. In fact, last week, starting in <a href=http://developer.coronalabs.com/release/2013/1141/>daily build</a> 1141, you can try your app out on iOS 7 Beta. On the right, you just select &#8220;7.0 beta&#8221; from the iOS device build dialog in the Corona Simulator, and presto, you&#8217;ve got an app built against the iOS 7 Beta SDK that you can test on your own device.</p>
<p>I really recommend you do try out your apps on iOS 7. If the past is any indication, we expect iOS 7 to introduce regression bugs that affect all iOS developers, not just Corona developers. The sooner you know about them, the less you&#8217;ll be surprised when iOS 7 is finally released!</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-36163" alt="Corona SDK supports Facebook Connect" src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-Shot-2013-06-17-at-9.25.24-PM.png" /><br />
(Our lawyers will bug me about this, so let me just remind you that if you are using iOS 7 Beta, you must honor Apple&#8217;s developer membership rules.)</p>
<p>We also have upgraded <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/facebook/>Corona&#8217;s Facebook support</a> on Android, so it&#8217;s on par with iOS. Now, you can run Facebook&#8217;s Scrumptious sample on Android just like you can on iOS.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also working on adding Facebook monetization features like <a href=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/tutorials/mobile-app-ads/>Mobile App Install Ads</a> that can help drive more installations of your app and increase discovery, all things that will help you make more money with your app! This should be coming in a daily build later this week.</p>

There were a bunch of other interesting checkins that you&#8217;ll notice in the <a href=http://developer.coronalabs.com/corona-daily-builds/summary>daily build notes</a> related to gaming, but the one I want to highlight is related to business apps or any app that&#8217;s dealing with lots of text.</p>
<p>In the next daily build, we are going to be giving more text alignment capabilities. You&#8217;ll be able to set left, center, right alignment on multiline text objects, the ones created by &#8216;display.newText()&#8217;. There will be more docs forthcoming on our <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/>daily build API docs</a>. I&#8217;ll update here when they&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The reference for the text alignment is <a href=http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/api/library/display/newText.html>here</a>.</p>

It&#8217;s simple to use and loads of fun; you can record up to a 5 second video and share with friends via SMS, or by selecting a recipient off your contact list that already has the app. As soon as your friend watches your creation, the video clip will self-destruct. </p>
