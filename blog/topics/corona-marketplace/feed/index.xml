		<description><![CDATA[There is a new plan for self-hosted plugins. Learn more about this new feature and how you can use it.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been several requests for a standalone self-hosted plugin plan. Self-hosted plugins are a method for studios who are making their own native plugins to create plugins, yet still use the simulator for building their apps. Normally if you need to use a custom plugin, you would have to use native builds to create and test each build.</p>
<p>Previously, the self-hosted plugin feature was part of the Unlimited Enterprise package.. Once we made native builds free, this feature was added to the <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/support/priority-plus-support target="_blank" rel="noopener">Priority Plus Support plan</a>. We have now made a standalone version of the self-hosted plugin plan. This feature is now available for $499/year and can be purchased in the <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/support/self-hosted-plugins target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corona Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Now studios can access this feature without the need for the additional support plan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-72770" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/facebook-an-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/facebook-an-150x150.png 150w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/facebook-an-300x300.png 300w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/facebook-an.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Our current <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/plugin/fbAudienceNetwork/index.html target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Audience Network</a> (F.A.N.) monetization plugin was originally created as a &#8220;revenue-share&#8221; plugin where a small percentage (5%) of your Facebook Audience Network ads are credited to a Corona Labs account.</p>
<p>Now, just like we did with <a href=/blog/2017/05/31/introducing-new-non-revenue-share-applovin-plugin/ target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppLovin</a> earlier this year, we offer the Facebook Audience Network in <strong>two</strong> forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/plugin/facebook-audience-network target="_blank" rel="noopener">original revenue-share version</a> where 5% of the delivered ads are attributed to Corona Labs.</li>
<li>A new <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/plugin/facebook-audience-network-paid target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid version</a> of the plugin without any revenue-share component. You keep 100% of your ad revenue and you manage your account directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new paid Facebook Audience Network plugin is available in the <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/plugin/facebook-audience-network-paid target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corona Marketplace</a> for $199/year.</p>
<p>To use the paid version:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the Corona Marketplace and purchase the <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/plugin/facebook-audience-network-paid target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Audience Network Paid</a> plugin.</li>
<li>In your <code>build.settings</code> file, change the plugin entry from <code>"plugin.fbAudienceNetwork"</code> to <code>"plugin.fbAudienceNetwork.paid"</code>.</li>
<li>Update any <code>require()</code> statements in your code:<br />
<code>local fbAudienceNetwork = require( "plugin.fbAudienceNetwork.paid" )</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Please visit our <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/plugin/fbAudienceNetwork/index.html target="_blank" rel="noopener">integration documentation</a> for instructions on how to get up and running with Facebook Audience Network.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Announcing our next Corona Marketplace contest! Enter to win a pair of Bose QC35 wireless headphones!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>NOTE: The contest deadline has been extended until Friday, April 7, 2017.</strong></p>
<p>Corona Labs invites you to participate in our next Marketplace contest! This time, your mission is to build a <strong>simple game template</strong> &#8212; code, art, and audio that can be used by other Corona developers as a template/foundation for their dream game. Entries will go into the <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Marketplace</a> for others to download and modify (see below).</p>
<p>The game should be &#8220;eye-catching and simple&#8221; &#8212; think of games like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird target="_blank"><em>Flappy Bird</em></a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game) target="_blank"><em>2048</em></a> where the mechanics are very basic but the game is challenging. Many of the most successful games were built around the concept of simplicity and the ability to just &#8220;jump right in&#8221; and play.</p>
<p><a href=/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MarketplaceContest2-2.png target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-69661 size-full" src=/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MarketplaceContest2-2.png width="730" height="300" /></a></p>
