		<description><![CDATA[So you want to be a successful indie game developer? Perhaps these 10 ideas might help you get there.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14747" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/goldmedal-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/goldmedal-150x150.png 150w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/goldmedal.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />We all want to make successful apps, but how do we get there? There are many different ideas of how to reach success and many different ways to get there, but it&#8217;s a challenging path. Think about <em>Fortnite&#8217;s</em> &#8220;Battle Royale&#8221; format. You start with 100 players and at the end only one person has climbed to the top and can claim &#8220;Victory Royale&#8221;.  Now imagine that but on a much grander scale.</p>
<p>Your indie title is competing against thousands of other indie titles and of course the &#8220;pro&#8221; AAA titles that come out as well.  Luck will sometimes favor you to the top. Hard work will sometimes propel you and other times it&#8217;s perseverance.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things for you to think about. <a href=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/author/PaulKilduffTaylor/764975/ target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Taylor</a>, the Joint Managing Director of Mode 7 Games, an indie studio based in Oxford, UK provides ten things for you to think about as you start building your next Indie title. Read over <a href=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/PaulKilduffTaylor/20180824/325218/The_10_Secrets_to_Indie_Game_Success_and_Why_They_Do_Not_Exist.php target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog post</a> which just might be the key to your next hit.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In this blog post we explore a three-part series on managing your resources when building games to get the best from your team without burning them out.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we explore a three-part blog series from Sara Casen, the co-founder at Midnight Hub, a five-person development team in Sweden. While many Corona developers are solo or small two-person shops, many others are working with even larger teams, but regardless of being solo or part of a team working smarter is always a good thing. While all of this might not apply to your situation, it&#8217;s certainly worth thinking about.</p>
<h4><img class="size-full wp-image-73147" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lake_ridden_screen1-1024x587.jpg" alt="Lake Ridden Screenshot" width="646" height="370" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lake_ridden_screen1-1024x587.jpg 646w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lake_ridden_screen1-1024x587-300x172.jpg 300w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lake_ridden_screen1-1024x587-345x198.jpg 345w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lake_ridden_screen1-1024x587-125x72.jpg 125w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /></h4>
<p>Lake Ridden is a story-driven first person mystery filled with puzzles, developed by former Minecraft and Paradox devs, in Sweden.</p>
<h4><a href=http://www.midnighthub.com/blog/2017/11/01/project-management-part-1-avoid-brain-damage-from-working-with-games/ target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 1 &#8211; Avoid Brain Damage From Working With Games</a></h4>
<p>According to Casen, the average career span of a game developer in Norwegian countries is about four years after which they are burned out. Long work-weeks, stress, unrealistic deadlines and other pressures create more problems that have to be solved. In this series she addresses how working more manageable hours lead to more productive hours.</p>
<h4><a href=http://www.midnighthub.com/blog/2017/11/09/project-management-part-2-making-your-game-with-the-abc-recipe/ target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 2 &#8211; Making Your Game With The ABC-Recipe</a></h4>
<p>In this part of the series, Casen talks about the ABC method for building your game up which has the net effect of defining deliverables in a more productive way. This is a unique way to look at managing your project from development to deliverable.</p>
<h4><a href=http://www.midnighthub.com/blog/2017/11/17/project-management-part-3-burning-money-brain-power-and-morale-to-make-your-game/ target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 3 &#8211; Burning Money, Brain Power and Morale To Make Your Game</a></h4>
<p>In the final part of this three-part series, Casen discusses resource management and how to manage more than time and money to get your team to their maximum efficiency without burning through all of your resources regardless of it being financial or human.</p>
<p>There is a lot of good information in these three posts that will be really helpful for any studio, building games or any other software product.</p>

In many cases, you build it, publish it to the various app stores, and then watch those installs&#8230; not pile up. Equally important as your artwork, your clever design, or your awesome coding, <strong>marketing</strong> apps is an area where many developers  lack the skills to do it properly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not all apps or games are best monetized by showing banner ads or interstitial ads at natural &#8220;breaks&#8221; in the gameplay. Sometimes monetization works best when it&#8217;s integrated directly alongside the gameplay.</p>
<p><a href=http://mobiledevmemo.com/ target="_blank">Mobile Dev Memo</a> recently did a <a href=http://mobiledevmemo.com/flip-diving-case-study-mobile-ad-monetization/ target="_blank">case study</a> on how the game <em>Flip Diving</em> creatively integrated ads and rewards as part of the game itself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most businesses want to understand their &#8220;churn rate.&#8221; In simple terms, this is how many customers you acquire and then lose over time. For app developers, a high churn rate indicates that people are willing to try your app, but they typically don&#8217;t like it and uninstall it. A low churn rate means you&#8217;re building a lasting relationship with your customers and they are likely to continue using your app.</p>
<p>With the collected data from customers using <a href=http://www.gameanalytics.com/ target="_blank">GameAnalytics</a>, data scientists did a massive study on player retention and came up with a <a href=http://www.gameanalytics.com/blog/16-reasons-players-leaving-game.html target="_blank">checklist of 16 items</a> you need to focus on to minimize your churn rate and keep users coming back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-67312 size-thumbnail" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kochava_Logo_NEW-150x43.png" alt="kochava_Logo_NEW" width="150" height="43" />Getting users to download and install your app requires that it can be discovered. With the volume of new apps showing up every day, being seen in the app store is no guarantee. If you&#8217;re lucky and get featured, that&#8217;s fantastic. Others become successful from going &#8220;viral&#8221; on social media. For many others, though, success comes from advertising &#8212; you contact an advertiser, create a campaign, and when other apps show ads for your app, your information is directly put in front of potential users.</p>
<p>Many developers advertise through more than one network, but the drawback is that you&#8217;ll only see data like &#8220;total installs&#8221; in the app store reporting &#8212; you can’t really tell <em>which</em> ad campaign the install came from. Fortunately, this is where <strong>attribution</strong> can come into play.</p>
<p><a href=https://support.kochava.com/reference-information/attribution-overview target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69278" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 25px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/AttributionOverview.gif" alt="attributionoverview" width="850" height="487" /></a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[There is considerably more than just great visuals and programming behind any successful app. To help you succeed, we have consolidated a checklist of important tasks to consider, both pre-launch and post-launch.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many, creating apps is about getting the code right, creating a great design, and implementing the visuals to make it work. While these are critical elements to success, it only scratches the surface of a successful application launch.</p>
<p>In addition to building a compelling app, these steps should also be part of your plan for success.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68755" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/checklistitems_appprep.png" alt="checklistitems_appprep" width="700" height="70" /></h2>
<h2>App Preparation</h2>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Include features that get you &#8220;Featured&#8221;</h3>
<p>Both Apple and Google will be more likely to feature your app if you include their game networking services (Game Center or Google Play Games Services). Also, including features like cloud storage and other advanced services will make your app appear more professional and well-rounded.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Include push notifications</h3>
<p>Push notifications are a great way to increase app engagement as long as they&#8217;re not abused. See our <a href=/blog/2016/10/12/business-of-apps-using-push-notifications-effectively/ target="_blank">previous post</a> for tips on how to effectively manage a push notification campaign.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Implement app analytics</h3>
<p>Knowing what your users are doing and how they are finding your app is a great way to measure your success. Both <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/plugin/kochava-app-analytics/index.html target="_blank">Kochava</a> and <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/plugin/tenjin/index.html target="_blank">Tenjin</a> provide great solutions for this.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Use source control for your code</h3>
<p>You may be working on version 2 of your app, but you need to fix a bug in version 1. Source control can be a lifesaver in such cases.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68756" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/checklistitems_marketing.png" alt="checklistitems_marketing" width="700" height="70" /></h2>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Research your competition</h3>
<p>What features are your competitors including? What is broken in their app? How can you make your app better? Knowing what works and what doesn&#8217;t can set your app apart from the crowd.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Build a list of contacts</h3>
<p>Discovering a list of blogs that cover the field your app is aiming for, as well as reaching out to other influential people, can provide a great launchpad for when your app is ready.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Research featured apps in your category</h3>
<p>Try to understand why featured apps earn their ranking. What attributes do they have in common? See what you can include in your app to also get your app featured.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Make a press kit</h3>
<p>There will be a time when you want to reach out to bloggers, review sites, or other places to promote your app. Make their lives easy by providing them with a high-resolution icon, some intriguing screen shots, and key talking points about your app.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Get social!</h3>
<p>You need to get your social media footprint established well before you launch your app. It takes time to build real followers for both <a href=https://facebook.com/ target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/ target="_blank">Twitter</a>. You need to be engaged with your followers so you don&#8217;t look like just another advertiser. Post in-progress screenshots from time to time and, most importantly, give people a way to talk about your app (it can’t be shared if you don’t have an account!).</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Publish a gameplay video (trailer)</h3>
<p>Record a short video of your game in action and make sure it shows off the best and most interesting aspects. A simple <a href=https://youtube.com/ target="_blank">YouTube</a> video will also give people another way to visually share your game across social media and on blogs.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Understand how SEO and ASO impacts app discovery</h3>
<p><strong>SEO</strong> (<strong>S</strong>earch <strong>E</strong>ngine <strong>O</strong>ptimization) is the technique that helps your content get discovered in searches. <strong>ASO</strong> (<strong>A</strong>pp <strong>S</strong>tore <strong>O</strong>ptimization) is a type of SEO for the app stores. Learn ASO best practices or hire a trusted professional to get your app to bubble to the top of searches.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Create a website</h3>
<p>A simple one page website is a great place to eventually place store links, support links, and your press kit. Be sure to provide links to your social media accounts and collect emails so you can notify people when your app launches!</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Join popular forums</h3>
<p>Getting involved with forums like <a href=http://toucharcade.com/ target="_blank">TouchArcade</a> and establishing yourself in the community can help build enthusiasm and excitement for your app.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68757" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/checklistitems_prelaunch.png" alt="checklistitems_prelaunch" width="700" height="70" /></h2>
<h2>Pre-Launch</h2>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Focus-test your app</h3>
<p>Find friends and potential customers and let them use the app. Watch how they interact with elements and look for places where they get stuck. Don’t explain the app to them, but just hand them the device and let them play. Do this multiple times as your app evolves.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Test launch in different geo-locations and localize</h3>
<p>Before you launch your app worldwide, try test launching it in different countries to see how it performs. Collect feedback and fix anything that needs to be addressed for a broader global launch. Also, you can greatly increase your app&#8217;s reach if you support multiple languages.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Learn your store&#8217;s requirements</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s good to know what the official submission guidelines are for the stores you plan to submit too. Review these and be prepared for what they are going to ask.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Beta-test your app</h3>
<p>You know how your app is supposed to work, but many bugs can be found by people who aren&#8217;t as familiar with it. Using <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/plugin/hockey/index.html target="_blank">HockeyApp</a> is a great way to cross-platform test your app.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Give your users a way to contact you in-app</h3>
<p>Getting feedback is always a good thing. It can help prevent 1-star ratings in the store which can be death for an app.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Collect some user data</h3>
<p>Build features into your app that let you collect contact information. Given that many users only open an app once or use it for less than three months, being able to reach out to them is a good way to keep your app in use.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Implement crash reporting</h3>
<p>Plugins like <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/plugin/hockey/index.html target="_blank">HockeyApp</a> or other analytics tools like <a href=https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-SDK-CORONA/wiki target="_blank">GameAnalytics</a> or <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/plugin/flurry-analytics/index.html target="_blank">Flurry Analytics</a> can catch crashes and report them to you. After all, you can&#8217;t fix it if you don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s happening!</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Build in a way to have &#8220;specials&#8221;</h3>
<p>Award extra points to people who complete quests or achieve goals. These also make great updates for later.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68758" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/checklistitems_launchday.png" alt="checklistitems_launchday" width="700" height="70" /></h2>
<h2>Launch Day</h2>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Get reviews as fast as you can</h3>
<p>Getting at least five 5-star reviews will raise your app&#8217;s profile. Get friends and family to rate your app and also leverage your beta testers. Ask in the <a href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/310088005728833/ target="_blank">Corona Indie Developer&#8217;s group</a> on Facebook (and rate their apps too!).</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Hit up public relations outlets</h3>
<p>Put your press kit to use! Engage that list of influential people and tech bloggers in your area and let them know about your app. Give them promo codes to help them experience your app beyond screenshots.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Consider a paid ad campaign</h3>
<p>Paying for long term acquisition of users may not be practical for you, but a limited campaign in the first few days can get your app the extra visibility it needs to rank high enough for people to find it on their own.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Announce in your forum threads</h3>
<p>You have been building up excitement in places like Touch Arcade, now reward those who have been following you with a few promo codes.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Engage your early adopters</h3>
<p>Reward them for sharing your app with in-app goodies or features that you can turn off after a few days.</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68759" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/checklistitems_postlaunch.png" alt="checklistitems_postlaunch" width="700" height="70" /></h2>
<h2>Post Launch</h2>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Update quickly</h3>
<p>While regular updates may not make a lot of sense for your app, you should plan to update fairly soon after app launch. Doing so shows users that you are making improvements to the app, even if they&#8217;re just minor cosmetic aspects. These updates are seen as a positive sign that you&#8217;re going to take care of the app over the long run.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Watch your Reviews</h3>
<p>Poor reviews can lead to more poor reviews. Try to reach out to the reviewer and find out what the issues are and then quickly help resolve them. Watch for other reviews and comments on social media as well.</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-68752" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Checkmark-1-150x150.png" alt="checkmark" width="20" height="20" />Use push notifications</h3>
<p>You built in notifications, now take advantage of them (responsibly). Do not spam your users, but push out occasional reminders and let them know about special events/quests that you&#8217;ve set up.</p>
<p>These post-launch activities are ongoing. Overall, you should plan to continuously iterate on all the items in this checklist to help achieve app longevity.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Achieving success for your game is a multi-faceted &#8220;art form&#8221; which begins well before your game is launched to the marketplace, and it continues long afterward. The above tips should help you navigate the process and see actual results!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Push notifications can be a powerful tool to keep your users engaged. Learn more about push notifications in this new "business of apps" series.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first article in a new series focused on the &#8220;business of apps.&#8221; Now that you have built a great app, what are your next steps? We hope this series of articles will help guide you to success!</p>
<h3>Push notifications</h3>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-68431 size-thumbnail" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pushnotifications-150x150.png" alt="pushnotifications" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pushnotifications-150x150.png 150w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pushnotifications-300x300.png 300w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pushnotifications-500x500.png 500w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pushnotifications.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />One of the most powerful tools in your app marketing toolkit is <strong>push notifications</strong>. Essentially, push notifications are small messages/alerts that you can send to users of your app, even when they are not actively running it.</p>
<p>Mobile users spend a lot of time each day using their mobile device, but most apps only get launched once. Push notifications are a great way to increase engagement at a low cost.</p>
<p>Measuring your success is tracked using two main metrics: <strong>opt-in rates</strong> and <strong>reaction rates</strong>, both of which we&#8217;ll outline in this article.</p>
<h3>Opt-in rates</h3>
<p><strong>Opt-in rates</strong> represent how many people have agreed to let you send them push notifications. On iOS, your users are prompted to allow push notifications &#8212; some people will choose to allow them (opt-in) while others will opt-out and decide they don&#8217;t want to be disturbed. On Android, in contrast, you will have a 100% opt-in rate since Google does not require asking the user.</p>
<p>According to <a href=http://www.accengage.com/benchmark-your-push-notification-opt-in-and-reaction-rates-on-ios-and-android-by-industry-and-country/ target="_blank">Accengage</a>, a company specializing in customer relationship management (CRM) and push notifications, the telecom, finance, and travel markets see the highest opt-in rates. Retail and fast-moving goods, such as things you buy at the grocery store, were near the bottom, while gaming sees a 36% opt-in rate on iOS (slightly below the average of 41% for all categories).</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-68434 size-medium alignright" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/optinrate-300x183.png" alt="optinrate" width="300" height="183" /></p>
<p>Since iOS only lets you show the opt-in permission once to request the user&#8217;s opt-in or opt-out, it&#8217;s generally best to wait until they have been using the app awhile instead of showing it immediately after the app starts up for the first time.</p>
<p>Also, opt-in rates are higher when you tell the user <em>why </em>they should opt-in. If they choose to do so, show them the iOS permission dialog at that time. If not, save the request until later &#8212; you can always prompt them again in the future or provide an option in your UI to allow them to opt-in.</p>
<h3>Reaction rates</h3>
<p>Reaction rates are a measure of how often the user interacts with push notifications. Reaction rates average 4.3% on iOS and 13.1% on Android, according to Accengage. While the fast-moving goods industry has the lowest opt-in rate, it has the highest reaction rate &#8212; iOS sees a 7.5% reaction rate and Android 25%, both nearly double the average. The gaming segment is just a touch below average.</p>
<p>Multiple factors impact reaction rates, including how often you send notifications, when you send them, and how engaging the messages are. Remember that push notifications are a source of interruption and while they can increase your engagement, they also risk annoying the user who may then choose to opt-out entirely.</p>
<p>Finding the &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; is important. In the next section, we&#8217;ll outline several considerations in sending push notifications.</p>
<h3>Using push notifications effectively</h3>
<p>Several factors and considerations go into a successful push notification campaign according to a <a href=https://home.tapjoy.com/blog/7-surprising-facts-open-rates-push-notifications/ target="_blank">study by Tapjoy</a>. Knowing what to send and when to send it are keys to improving your reaction rates.</p>
<h4>Message frequency</h4>
<p>How often you send push notifications can greatly impact the success of your campaign. Multiplayer games which broadcast a player&#8217;s turn in the game can be sent when necessary. However, reminders to <em>play</em> your game should be more sparse. Your &#8220;industry&#8221; factors in as well. A news app might push breaking news alerts several times a day, but that amount of marketing messages would be far too high.</p>
<p>In fact, if you take breaking news and multiplayer game turns out of the equation to focus on marketing-based notifications, Tapjoy&#8217;s study found that sending them <strong>once per week</strong> had more than double the reaction rate compared to monthly pushes, and more than <em>triple</em> the reaction rate of daily pushes. Clearly, the sweet spot for marketing notifications is weekly pushes!</p>
<h4>Using sounds</h4>
<p>Sounds can be a great way to alert the user that they should interact with your app, but those sounds can come at inopportune times such as during a meeting or while users are sleeping. Tapjoy&#8217;s study found that silent push notifications were responded to more than twice as often as notifications that included sounds. Also, using notification sounds in multiplayer games with frequent turn reminders can give the user a sense that you&#8217;re &#8220;blowing up their phone.&#8221; In short, use sounds sparingly and wisely!</p>
<h4>Day of the week</h4>
<p>Reaction rates are fairly consistent across different days of the week, but Monday has a slightly higher reaction rate than any other day of the week. Friday and Saturday are the lowest, but Sunday sees an upward increase again. Plan your marketing pushes during weekdays for best results.</p>
<h4>Time of day</h4>
<p>Time of day is an important factor as well. If your push notification includes a sound effect, sending it while users are sleeping is a fast route to negative reviews and opt-outs &#8212; after all, not everybody silences their mobile device at night. Tapjoy&#8217;s study showed that sending push notifications during the middle of the day in the local time zone showed a significant increase in average revenue per daily average user.</p>
<h4>Certain phrases perform better</h4>
<p>Tapjoy&#8217;s study found that the messaging phrase matters considerably. Starting the message with &#8220;<em>Get your …</em>&#8221; leads to the best reaction rate while terms like &#8220;<em>Come back &#8230;</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>Collect &#8230;</em>&#8221; did not work well. Essentially, &#8220;call to action&#8221; phrasing prompts the user to respond with more urgency, yielding a higher success rate.</p>
<h4>Segmenting users</h4>
<p>Not every user is interested in everything you offer. A classic example of this are news apps. Sports fans like to know when the score in their favorite games change. Other users are interested in traffic or weather alerts and aren&#8217;t interested in sports. Fortunately, many push notification systems allow you to &#8220;segment&#8221; your audience into areas of interest. Tracking behaviors or gathering certain user data within your app is yet another way to help fine-tune your push notification campaigns.</p>
<h3>Implementing notifications in Corona-built apps</h3>
<p>Corona Labs provides APIs to let you register your device with both <a href=https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html?#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH100-SW9/ target="_blank">Apple&#8217;s APNS</a> (Apple Push Notification Service) and <a href=https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ target="_blank">Google&#8217;s GCM </a>(Google Cloud Messaging). You can use the registration event to register with the push notification service of your choice. Please consult the <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/events/appNotification/index.html target="_blank">Local/Push Notifications</a> guide for more information.</p>
<p>In addition, Corona Labs has a push notification partner in <a href=https://onesignal.com/ target="_blank">OneSignal</a>. OneSignal provides a great plugin to simplify implementation of push notifications in your app, both from a registration perspective and app-to-app messaging.</p>
<p>OneSignal supports many powerful tools to reach your users. For example, you can easily send reminders to players involved in your multiplayer game (for turn management). OneSignal also does a great job of handling inbound push notifications. Their dashboard supports real-time tracking so you can monitor your own conversion rates, and they support A/B testing which is a great way to test the effectiveness of different messages. As if that&#8217;s not enough, you can segment your messages to provide better targeting to your users and you can even schedule notifications to be sent at optimum times, directly from their dashboard. To get started, <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/plugin/onesignal target="_blank">activate OneSignal</a> in the marketplace and then proceed to their <a href=https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/corona-sdk target="_blank">documentation</a> for usage details.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Push notifications are a powerful way to engage your users, but they should be used wisely. Deliver valuable messages, respect your users, call them to action, and succeed!</p>
