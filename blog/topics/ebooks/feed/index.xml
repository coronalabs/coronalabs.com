				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently we have showcased some incredible mobile games from the Corona developer community. This week, we turn our focus to a genre that isn&#8217;t covered as frequently: interactive books.</p>
<p><a href=http://yoozoobooks.com/12huiabirds.html target="_blank"><em>12 Huia Birds</em></a> is an interactive story about the extinction of the huia bird in New Zealand. Written by Julian Stokoe and illustrated by Stacy Eyles, this amazing duo brings the ill-fated avian back to life as part of a richly interactive story.</p>

Built using Corona, the book makes heavy use of <a href=http://esotericsoftware.com/ target="_blank">Spine</a> from <a href=http://esotericsoftware.com/ target="_blank">Esoteric Software</a> to create lively animations in the story. &#8220;The birds are all Spine files which loop animation cycles randomly. These were created before mesh was available so we are having fun with mesh for our next book app,&#8221; Stokoe said.</p>
<p>The story unfolds as you touch various actors and engage in other eye-catching animations. One such animation includes a 360-degree view where you swipe your way around the bird to see it from various angles. Various worksheets and activities can also be downloaded from the app&#8217;s companion website to use in educational settings.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the huia was lost before the invention of audio capture devices. So, their songs have been recreated based on musical notations written down by ornithologists at a time when the bird was still alive, as well as whistles recorded in the 1950s by a man who recalled the sound from his childhood.</p>

<p><em>12 Huia Birds</em> won backing from <a href=http://www.nzonair.govt.nz/ target="_blank">NZ On Air&#8217;s Digital Media Fund</a> which allows <a href=http://yoozoobooks.com/ target="_blank">Yoozoo</a> to produce the book for free. Unlike many books that start in print and then are adapted to digital, this one is going the opposite direction, beginning digital with a print version in the future.</p>
