In <em>this series</em>, guest blogger Alex Jackson highlights outstanding threads from the <a href=http://forum.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Forum</a>. The goal is to bring attention to the most captivating, interesting, and thought-provoking discussions taking place in our very own backyard.</em></p>

<h3>Math libraries</h3>
<p>Shorthand geometry has never been my strong suit. I’ve always struggled with the area of a triangle, circumference of a circle, or any number of esoteric vector math functions. However, it’s vital to have some grasp of these concepts when engaging in extensive game development &#8212; but going back and forth between trigonometry documentation and your code is no way to live! That’s why it’s so nice that there are several math libraries for us to leverage. Extending the usefulness of Corona’s baked-in <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/math/index.html>math</a> library, we can start using some simple shorthand functions, easing us into the proverbial bathtub of complicated arithmetic scenarios.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63285-working-out-angle-to-apply-force/ target="_blank">original thread here</a> to grab some info on math libraries. Have a helper module of our own? We’d love to hear about it!</p>
<h3>Dusk 1.0 beta</h3>
<p>One of the first posts we highlighted in the <em>From the Forum</em> series was the up-and-coming developments of a little software studio called <strong>Gymbyl Coding</strong>. Over the years, <strong>Caleb</strong>, the main man at Gymbyl, has gifted the Corona community with awesome modules to extend the usefulness of the already-useful Corona SDK.</p>
<p>One of the main focuses of Gymbyl in the last year has been their <strong>Dusk</strong> game engine. What started out as a basic tile management system evolved into a fully-realized library that has helped many new and veteran developers quickly produce fantastic games.</p>
<p>Now, Dusk 1.0 has entered beta testing and it’s your chance to help Gymbyl kick the tires. Head down to <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/61794-in-development-dusk-10/ target="_blank">the original thread</a> to get in on this great opportunity!</p>
<h3>Stopping objects with a touch</h3>
<p>When prototyping simple object movement mechanics in your games, it’s easy to become entranced by the siren song of updating coordinates during the “moved” phase of a touch function. Dead simple, but it isn’t as extensible when you start dealing with physics objects.</p>
<p>Physics objects need some additional TLC to work with a user’s touch interaction, and this is what initiated the birth of the physics touch joint. This joint lets us modify the location of a physics object without Box2d throwing a fit.</p>
<p>Check out <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63392-how-to-stop-movement-of-physics-object-with-touch/ target="_blank">the original thread</a> that discusses one approach to using touch joints, and stick around for other samples that <strong>RoamingGamer</strong> drops on us. That guy is the gift who keeps on giving!</p>

<h3>Custom drop shadow on your text objects</h3>
<p>Getting custom text objects to appear accurately 100% of the time can feel like a bit of a magic act. Sometimes it feels like it would be easier to pull a rabbit out of a hat than ensure that all of our text effects, scaling and kerning has been implemented correctly across the board.</p>
<p>One of the issues I always run into is the ability to add a nice shadow or outline effect to my text objects. There is of course <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/display/newEmbossedText.html target="_blank">display.newEmbossedText()</a> which works well in simple cases, but it is simply not robust enough to handle all of the logical gymnastics we might throw at it. Unfortunately, another developer had the same issues, and looked to the community for some assistance. Fortunately, a bunch of developers came out to throw their solutions into the ring.</p>
<p>There are some pretty useful solutions and code snippets for this problem contained in the below thread. Click through and check’em out!</p>
<p><a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/62161-text-drop-shadow target="_blank">https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/62161-text-drop-shadow</a></p>
<h3>A thorough check inside of onComplete</h3>
<p>The onComplete() callback function that Corona provides is, as we all know, invaluable when paired with Corona’s event-driven model. With an asynchronous system, returning control to your app is a matter of course, and as Rob Miracle’s excellent tutorial points out:</p>
<p>“When these events complete, they notify your program that they’re finished and allow you an opportunity to respond”</p>
<p>The handling of these returned values takes place in a callback function. But what if you want to use something a bit more complex with only one callback function. Exactly the same issue was posted in the forums earlier, and the question received some fantastic responses. The suggestions were fantastic, and you would do well to read through the entire thread!</p>

<h3>Swiping the day away</h3>
<p>I’ve got quite an interesting thread on tap here that displays some deft mathematics for identifying some crucial user interaction. By detecting the movement of a single finger on the screen and comparing the present touch with the delta X/Y location. This has the added wrinkle of using separate functions for location detection, which, in my opinion, is an underused and oft-overlooked technique. Head on through to the original thread to learn more about how you can implement this functionality in your app now!</p>

<p>Last week on Corona Geek Hangout 144, we talked about <a href=/blog/coronageek/corona-geek-144/>improving touch based game performance using touch coalescing</a>. We also looked at using image masks to <a href=https://github.com/roaminggamer/CoronaGeek/raw/master/Hangouts/Tips_and_Tricks/dialTimer.zip target="_blank">create a circular dial timer</a>, similar to what we’ve seen before from <a href=http://www.jasonschroeder.com/2015/02/25/timer-2-0-library-for-corona-sdk/ target="_blank">Jason Schroeder</a>.</p>
<p>We also talked with QuestLord developer, Eric Kinkead about his <a href=http://www.questlord.com/ target="_blank">coming release of QuestLord 2</a> and his fun Camera Pixel <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixel-camera/id877241872 target="_blank">camera app</a>.</p>
