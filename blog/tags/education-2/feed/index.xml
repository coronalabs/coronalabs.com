				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-66126" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vIay5wqa-150x150.png" alt="vIay5wqa" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vIay5wqa-150x150.png 150w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vIay5wqa-300x300.png 300w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vIay5wqa-500x500.png 500w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vIay5wqa.png 551w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />In this post, we highlight <a href=https://www.doodlemaths.com/ target="_blank">DoodleMaths</a> by <a href=http://www.ezeducation.co.uk/ target="_blank">EZ Education</a>. DoodleMaths is an intuitive math app for children that allows them to consistently work at the best level for them. Its algorithm works to understand the level a child is currently working at and then it creates a work program for them so they can continually consolidate and learn new topics, rather than playing it safe and only doing what they know well.</p>
<p>Tom Minor, along with co-founder Nicola Chilman, founded EZ Education in 2012 with the aim of enhancing  the way kids learn through adaptive learning programs. As experienced classroom educators, they have first-hand experience working with kids, and DoodleMaths is the top-selling math app for elementary school children in the UK.</p>
<p><iframe width="1060" height="596" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvokxEqIDOo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>DoodleMaths has won many accolades. &#8220;We have had 5-star reviews from the Educational App Store and have recently won Best Mobile App at The SPARKies, run by TechSPARK. We have been in the top 10 of the education apps in iTunes, and we have been shortlisted for KPMG&#8217;s Best British Mobile Startup,&#8221; says Tom. &#8220;As a company, we have received numerous rewards and can proudly say we have the best selling primary maths app in the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-66127" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen640x640.jpeg" alt="screen640x640" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<h3>Building their app</h3>
<p>The developers realized how much children engage with tablets and the huge potential for them to learn in a way that individually suits their needs. Their background as teachers and tutors meant that they had first-hand experience of how an app could work alongside common teaching methods in order to draw the most out of the child.</p>
<p>For EZ Education, app development is an ongoing process, so they continuously iterate on their design and code base. The company has used Corona for development of their three existing applications and their upcoming fourth application. Thanks to Corona and the Lua language, they can develop a core app in around three months and smaller projects even faster.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-66128" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/unnamed.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="512" height="384" /></p>
<p>When asked about advice for developers, Tom says &#8220;My first bit of advice would be for newcomers. I would recommend that they read the tutorials and try out some sample applications to see how much time they could save. Corona really streamlines the development process.&#8221; He continues, &#8220;It was important to my team to establish a set of programming standards and best practices and we were easily able to find wonderful examples on the Corona <a href=https://code.coronalabs.com/code target="_blank">Code Exchange</a>. I recommend that others look there for patterns and inspiration when developing their own application.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Going online</h3>
<p>Some developers chase problems which they have little experience in solving. For some, it&#8217;s a challenge to learn new things, but sometimes recognizing that you need help is an important step. For EZ Education, their staff is educators. Building and hosting an online service is challenging, but DoodleMaths needed features to enable teachers to get the most out of the app. EZ Education found the solution in Bluefuse Systems (<a href=http://www.bluefusesystems.com>www.bluefusesystems.com/</a>) to develop parent and teacher dashboards. These dashboards contain features such as live monitoring, live messaging, and leaderboards, giving the students the ability to challenge each other while keeping the parents and teachers involved in their progress.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you want to check out DoodleMaths and EZ Education&#8217;s other apps, visit their <a href=https://www.doodlemaths.com/ target="_blank">website</a> at <a href=https://www.doodlemaths.com/ target="_blank">https://www.doodlemaths.com/</a>. From there, you can download each of their apps on all of the supported platforms. DoodleMaths is a fun (but serious) tool used to educate children, and it was all built with Corona SDK. <a href=/ target="_blank">Get started today!</a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Learn how a forward thinking university in West Texas is bringing mobile development to the main stream for it's students and how Corona SDK is making the program richer and more rewarding for its students.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href=/products/corona-sdk/ target="_blank">Corona SDK</a>, along with <a href=/products/enterprise/ target="_blank">Corona Enterprise</a> and <a href=http://coronacards.com/ target="_blank">CoronaCards</a>, are used by a wide variety of developers and usually with great success. This week we want to highlight one of those success stories: Abilene Christian University and <a href=http://www.acu.edu/academics/sitc/faculty/burton-brian.html target="_blank">Dr. Brian Burton, Ed.D</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3>What is the background of ACU (age, number of students, locations, etc.)?</h3>
<p>Abilene Christian University (ACU) is a liberal arts university located in West Texas. Founded in 1906, ACU currently has more than 4,500 students and is a leader in Christian higher education.</p>
<p>In 2008, ACU was nationally recognized as the first university to offer iPhones or iPod touches to its incoming freshman. It has since been named the No. 2 Most Innovative Schools in U.S. News &amp; World Report (2016), 2014 Apple Distinguished School, on Forbes list of America’s Top Colleges for 2014, 2009 Institutional Excellence Award ACUTA, and named a College of Distinction in 2015.</p>
<p>ACU offers courses in Digital Entertainment and Mobile Computing programming with concentrations in digital design, game development, and film production.</p>
<h3>What is your background (technical and teaching)?</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-65147" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Brian-Burton2-200x300.jpg" alt="Brian-Burton2" width="200" height="300" />I am one of the original computer geeks. I got started programming in high school on a TRS-80. In college, I majored in Computer Information Systems and Secondary Education (double major) and minored in Computer Science.</p>
<p>In 2007, I joined the faculty at Abilene Christian University where I developed a major and minor Digital Entertainment Technology, which offers an interdisciplinary approach to game development.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2009, after the introduction of the iOS SDK, I began teaching mobile app development courses.</p>
<h3>How did you first learn about Corona?</h3>
<p>In 2008, ACU became the first University to adopt the use of the iPhone in a major mobile emphasis on campus. As a part of that emphasis we started teaching mobile application development. For the first couple of years that was strictly Objective-C.</p>
<p>In early 2010, I began looking for a better way to teach app development. I was frustrated that to develop an app for iOS and Android required a complete re-programming of the project and knew there had to be a better way.</p>
<p>While I found several options for developing cross-platform applications, Corona was clearly head and shoulders above the rest.</p>
<h3>Why are you using Corona?</h3>
<p>The final decision to use Corona was made easy by Corona’s capability to be flexible and build for so many different platforms. With Corona, our students could develop sophisticated apps and games in a fraction of the time. Competing SDKs permitted us to make only apps OR games, not both.</p>
<h3>How is Corona being used in class?</h3>
<p>In the Introduction to Information, Technology, and Computing, the course project is centered on using Corona to learn how to program and develop mobile applications and games.</p>
<p>Our Introduction to Mobile Application class is for non-majors who want to learn the basics of app development. The class introduces how to program using LUA and Corona SDK.</p>
<p>In Mobile Computing I &amp; II, which are for Computer Science and Information Technology majors, Corona is used to provide students experience in developing cross-platform applications. These classes make use of the more advanced features such as GPS, accelerometer, and client/server systems.</p>
<p>In Digital Entertainment courses, students use Corona to prototype and develop mobile games. Corona has become our primary tool for developing 2D games and apps.</p>
<h3>What have been the results of using Corona?</h3>
<p>Corona has enabled me to spend more class time teaching how to make apps instead of teaching Objective-C or Java. Projects that were taking 6 weeks to complete are now completed in days. This extra time has allowed me as a professor to go deeper into app development, human-computer interface considerations, and network concerns. My students are now able to learn far more in one semester than when I was teaching pure iOS development.</p>
<h3>Would you recommend Corona to other schools?</h3>
<p>It depends on the school’s goal. Do they want their students to learn one development environment that will most likely change significantly with the next version or do they want to teach their students to make apps and games quickly and effectively without getting bogged down in the semantics of a single platform? Without question, Corona is the right choice for our university.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your textbooks</h3>
<p>I started migrating to Corona in 2010. I made the decision that the next academic year we would shift completely to Corona. So, I needed support materials. This was the early days of Corona and while the documentation was good, it wasn’t what was needed for a classroom. Thus I found myself writing lessons that could be used for my classes. This evolved into the first textbook Beginning Mobile App Development with Corona.</p>
<p>All of my textbooks are updated regularly at no additional cost. They are available at <a href=http://BurtonsMediaGroup.com/books target="_blank">Burton&#8217;s Media Group</a>.</p>
<h3>Sample student projects</h3>
<p>Here is a sample of the apps produced by students using Corona SDK.</p>
<h4>5 Second Frenzy</h4>
<p>A fast paced collection of mini games that will challenge your wits as well as your reflexes. Players have 5 seconds to solve each puzzle, each uniquely utilizing touch, tilt, or motion controls. See how long you can last and if you can solve each puzzle in time!</p>

<p>In July 2013, Shawn taught a 2-week mobile game development camp for high school students, using Corona SDK. Based on his experience, Shawn shared 4 tips for working with young developers</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>When it comes to technology, youth have the potential to do a lot more than many adults give them credit. In fact, I believe it is the inhibitions of the adult that often result in youth being forced to take baby steps when they are ready to learn to run. For example, when I tell adults that I teach youth to make mobile games, the first thing I am often asked is if I&#8217;m using a drag and drop game creator. Many are surprised that the answer is &#8220;No&#8221; &#8211; that I am teaching them to write real code with <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com>Corona/ SDK</a> and the <a href=http://www.lua.org/>Lua</a> language. While drag and drop tools are great introductory solutions (we use Scratch with our elementary age kids), youth can do so much more. Giving passionate teenagers drag and drop programming tools is like giving high schoolers <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Logs>Lincoln Logs</a> in shop class.</p>
<p>Still hesitant to use real power tools when teaching code? Here are some essential tips that I&#8217;ve found useful for technology education:</p>
<p><strong>1. Fast Feedback</strong> &#8211; Young programmers need to be able to get feedback as quickly as possible on how changes to their code impact their game. Whether this is a crash or moving a sprite image on the screen, the faster they can see the result, the faster they can learn. Waiting for a recompile of their game can slow down learning and provides an opportunity for distraction to creep in. That&#8217;s why I love that Corona SDK automatically detects changed files and prompts to reload the game. Because Lua is a scripting language, the game doesn&#8217;t have to recompile and the changes are shown almost instantly.</p>
<p>This also means that any instruction that is meant to teach youth to code needs to have them seeing results very quickly. You can&#8217;t have a 45 minute lecture about text objects and expect them to keep focus. Instead, skip the lecture and jump to the code. Letting them learn by trial and error breaks down the fear of &#8220;messing up.&#8221; In our program, our goal is to have youth create a &#8220;Hello World&#8221; app as fast as possible.</p>
<p><center><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalharborfoundation/9452305912/ title="IMG_1552 by DHFBaltimore, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5532/9452305912_f2e25dc3eb.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1552"></a></center></p>
<p><strong>2. It Has To Be Relevant</strong> &#8211; Young people are really perceptive and they want to learn things that they know will apply to their life. Teaching them a programming language that is not used in the real world is very limiting.</p>
<p>There is a reason Latin isn&#8217;t taught very often anymore. Sure it will help you in your understanding of language but quite frankly, most of us can learn to read, write and talk without knowing Latin. As a senior in high school, I took AP Computer Science and the language they taught was Pascal. We knew that the following year they would no longer be using Pascal because it wasn&#8217;t relevant anymore. The giant wheels of education had been set in motion, however, and there was no turning this machine on a relevant path for my class. While Pascal did teach me programming, it was not immediately employable.</p>
<p><center><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalharborfoundation/9350680537/ title="IMG_1203 by DHFBaltimore, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/9350680537_da7ee446ec.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1203"></a></center></p>
<p>Corona SDK has been used to create games for <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/case-study/primal-screen-thomas-friends-mix-up-match-up/>Thomas &#038; Friends</a>, <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/case-study/corona-sdk-works-with-blockdot-and-dr-seuss-the-lorax/>Dr. Seuss&#8217; The Lorax Movie</a>, and used by companies such as <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/case-study/macmillians-priddy-books-launches-a-series-of-early-learning-apps-for-ipad/>Macmillan</a> and local dev shops <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/case-study/mindgrub-zach-haley-scuba-adventure/>Mindgrub</a> and <a href=http://www.purebang.com/about.html>Pure Bang Games</a>. Those are just opportunities for Corona SDK specifically; the Lua language opens up even more possibilities. Most importantly, however, is the fact that youth can create something to put on their own device right away and spread it around to friends and family. It is relevant because it lives in the real-world, not just in a grade book or on a report card.</p>
<p><center><a title="IMG_1567 by DHFBaltimore, on Flickr" href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalharborfoundation/9452304348/><img alt="IMG_1567" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/9452304348_04395144fc.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></center></p>
<p><strong>3. Let Them Explore</strong> &#8211; In our most recent program, we taught youth how to create a basic whack-a-mole style game in about a week. Then, over the course of a second week, we let the students work on a prototype game of their own. The prototype could have been as simple as a modification to the whack-a-mole game or an entirely new game prototype for youth who excelled at the program. Within two weeks, we had 9 different game prototypes from youth ranging in age from 11-18, each with a wide variety of tech experience. Letting youth dream up their own ideas and make them happen is truly empowering. It&#8217;s also how they attain a true mastery of the content. Additionally, when it is their idea, students will spend a lot more time problem solving, trouble-shooting, and debugging because it is relevant to them!</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Harbor-Foundation-group.jpg" alt="Harbor Foundation group" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41498" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Writing Skills</strong> &#8211; A lot of people fear programming because they have heard that so much math is involved.  This is true as you get further into programming but the most relevant skill needed by a new programmer is actually skill in writing.  More often than not, bugs in a new programmer&#8217;s code are caused by spelling mistakes or syntax errors, such as the wrong capitalization, spacing, or punctuation (e.g. a colon instead of a period).  I often tell new programmers that writing code is very much like writing a paper for an English class except that instead of getting red marks on your paper for mistakes, you get error messages or unexpected behaviors.  If youth can master how to diagnose issues and spot errors in their code, they will be able to accomplish a lot more in less time.</p>
