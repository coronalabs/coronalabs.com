In this post, we highlight a few <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Community Forums</a> posts that cover important topics.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2ihwUsX target="_blank">Building a conveyor belt</a></h4>
<p>Forum star <strong>roaminggamer</strong> chimed in to help someone figure out how to move objects from one place to another in a conveyor belt fashion. Check out his solution in <a href=http://bit.ly/2ihwUsX target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2jksgMF target="_blank">It&#8217;s all a blur!</a></h4>
<p>When iOS 7 came out and included blurred background effects, blurring things has been all the rage. So how can you blur items in Corona? One developer was curious about blurring his app&#8217;s entire screen and forum frequent flyer <strong>ojnab</strong> &#8220;clarified&#8221; things in <a href=http://bit.ly/2jksgMF target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2ie7hhL target="_blank">Through the looking glass</a></h4>
<p>Many platform games limit the play area for a level to something reasonable, memory efficiency being one of the main reasons. These games usually involve an invisible one-way portal which bridges sections of a level. In <a href=http://bit.ly/2ie7hhL target="_blank">this thread</a>, learn how to accomplish this in your game.</p>

In this post, we highlight a few <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Community Forums</a> posts that cover important topics.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2huvRsK target="_blank">Flipping cards</a></h4>
<p>In a 2D system, objects have no depth. You can easily flip an image horizontally by setting its <code>xScale</code> property to <code>-1</code> and use a transition to get a nice animation, except that it disappears briefly as the scale hits exactly <code>0</code>. Fortunately, forum stars <strong>Steve Johnson (StarCrunch)</strong> and <strong>Dave Bollinger</strong> chimed in on <a href=http://bit.ly/2huvRsK target="_blank">this thread</a> with some different techniques to improve the common case of flipping a card.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2iGkakv target="_blank">Rockets Red Glare</a></h4>
<p>If you want to launch a rocket, there generally should be a smoke trail following it, and that smoke eventually fades. In <a href=http://bit.ly/2iGkakv target="_blank">this thread</a>, follow our forum heroes trying to accomplish this task.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2iGc2Ar target="_blank">Lights! Camera! Action!</a></h4>
<p>For games in a 3D world, lighting is a major consideration &#8212; your objects are made up of meshes, textures, and maps that take the position of lights, ultimately rendering a visible object. In a 2D world, we don&#8217;t think about this much, but there are times where you may need dynamic lighting in a 2D world. <a href=http://bit.ly/2iGc2Ar target="_blank">This thread</a> goes into the possibilities of 3D-style lighting using Corona&#8217;s advanced graphics features.</p>

<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2hp5Efg target="_blank">Finer control for emitters</a></h4>
<p>Corona&#8217;s built-in <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/display/newEmitter.html target="_blank">particle emitters</a> are quite powerful and they can do some amazing things, but sometimes you need to go beyond &#8220;normal&#8221; to get the effect you want. In <a href=http://bit.ly/2hp5Efg target="_blank">this post</a>, learn how you can change particle parameters while the emitter runs.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2h4zm6w target="_blank">Aligning your score</a></h4>
<p>Most games need a score GUI, but an unexplained number on the screen doesn&#8217;t convey a lot of information. Adding a text label like &#8220;<strong>Score:</strong>&#8221; will clarify what the number means, but how can you keep everything aligned? <a href=http://bit.ly/2h4zm6w target="_blank">This post</a> offers several tips to help with the issue.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2hAV6Y7 target="_blank">Sharpening up your sprites</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes your artwork won&#8217;t fit the size you want and Corona will need to resize the image to fill the area you requested. Sometimes this can result in blurry images. Fortunately, you have the ability to change how images get resized and <a href=http://bit.ly/2hAV6Y7 target="_blank">this post</a> explains how.</p>

<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2fSmdjd target="_blank">Chains on the edge of tomorrow</a></h4>
<p>One of the powerful features of Corona Labs&#8217; implementation of Box2D physics is the ability to simulate &#8220;chains.&#8221; Chains, also referred to as &#8220;edge shapes,&#8221; are useful when you want to construct hills, slopes, and other physical shapes that bend the typical rules of Box2D. Basically, they are constructed from a series of vertices that define the link segments &#8212; but just how many vertices can you use? Are there other gotchas? Corona&#8217;s own <strong>Brent Sorrentino</strong> jumped into <a href=http://bit.ly/2fSmdjd target="_blank">this thread</a> to clear up the details.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2gi4UbW target="_blank">How to make semi-circles</a></h4>
<p>Corona&#8217;s powerful vector APIs are great for making boxes, circles, and polygons, but what if you want an arc or a semi-circle? Some enterprising Corona developers contributed to <a href=http://bit.ly/2gi4UbW target="_blank">this thread</a> with some inventive solutions.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2g4KRuG target="_blank">What goes up must go… up?</a></h4>
<p>When using physics in a game, not everybody wants 9.8 m/s² of gravity pulling objects toward the ground. Sometimes you want things to float in air, or maybe even go upwards! What&#8217;s more is that, in certain cases, you&#8217;ll want only <em>some</em> objects to behave outside the bounds of the &#8220;world gravity&#8221; setting. Fortunately, as illustrated in <a href=http://bit.ly/2g4KRuG target="_blank">this post</a>, you easily <em>can</em> control gravity on an object-by-object basis.</p>

Each week, we highlight a few <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Labs Community Forum</a> posts that cover important topics.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2fYaqQX target="_blank">It&#8217;s a confetti party!</a></h4>
<p>Corona includes a pretty powerful <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/display/newEmitter.html target="_blank">particle emitter</a> system which has a slew of parameters. A recent forum poster wanted to have confetti fly when the player won the game, but the confetti had &#8220;transparency&#8221; which allowed the background to show through, an effect that wasn&#8217;t desired. Corona&#8217;s own <strong>Brent Sorrentino</strong> chimed in with a &#8220;solid&#8221; answer. Head over to <a href=http://bit.ly/2fYaqQX target="_blank">the original thread</a> to learn how to control the OpenGL blending properties of particles.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2fWfrHf target="_blank">A command performance</a></h4>
<p>The concept of a &#8220;command line&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make sense in the mobile or TV space, in contrast to desktop operating systems where opening the Terminal or Command Prompt is a common practice. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great to start up a Corona-built desktop app using additional parameters? Fortunately, this option is supported through command line arguments. In <a href=http://bit.ly/2fWfrHf target="_blank">this thread</a>, Corona Engineer <strong>Josh Quick</strong> explains how to run your Corona apps using this additional information&#8230; oh, and it <em>does</em> work on mobile and TV, through URL schemes and push notifications!</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2fWRmhY target="_blank">But I <em>did</em> remove the object!</a></h4>
<p>Getting a grasp on memory management can be a challenge. With Lua, understanding who has references to objects can present challenges to even seasoned developers. In this case, the poster noticed that a table that had been removed and <code>nil</code>&#8216;ed seemed to have a ghost table hanging around. Fortunately, expert Corona developers <strong>@torbenratzlaff</strong> and <strong>@roaminggamer</strong> explain in <a href=http://bit.ly/2fWRmhY target="_blank">the thread</a> how to ensure the release of all references to an object.</p>

Each week we highlight a few <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Labs Community Forums</a> posts that cover important topics.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2epdllp target="_blank">Handling global collisions</a></h4>
<p>Detecting when physical objects collide is an important concept in games and Corona features several ways to test for it. In <a href=http://bit.ly/2epdllp target="_blank">this post</a>, learn how to determine exactly which objects are colliding and prevent them from creating unnecessary interactions.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2eKZKjR target="_blank">Which button was pressed?</a></h4>
<p>Corona touch handlers are incredibly easy to implement if you simply want to know when a touch begins, moves, or ends. However, if you need to do more advanced testing like determining when a player presses two or three buttons simultaneously, it takes a little more logic. Check out <a href=http://bit.ly/2eKZKjR target="_blank">this post</a> for a few helpful tips.</p>
<h4><a href=http://bit.ly/2eQ9IDL target="_blank">Getting snapshots to work with GPGS</a></h4>
<p>Corona is fast… sometimes too fast. In a few cases, your code may be ready to move on to other tasks while other API calls still need time to complete. To keep things moving, API calls operate asynchronously, behind the scenes. Check out <a href=http://bit.ly/2eQ9IDL target="_blank">this thread</a> which discusses how to handle delayed calls.</p>
