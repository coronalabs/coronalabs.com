Starting this time last Friday, members of the team hung out at Global Game Jam in San Francisco and it was wicked awesome.

<p>It&#8217;s been a crazy busy week here at Corona Labs. Here&#8217;s a quick recap of some the things we&#8217;ve been working on this week.</p>
<p>Starting this time last Friday, members of the team hung out at Global Game Jam in San Francisco and it was wicked awesome. There were a ton of creative people all packed into one big warehouse sized space and I got to talk with some amazingly talented people. Here are some <a href=https://plus.google.com/108159899655420864045/posts/SEEqU5dGJxN target="_blank">images and video from Global Game Jam, San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t a normal Monday Corona Geek hangout this week because I was flying back from California, but I did have the opportunity to talk with Ricardo Rauber Pereira about his new Corona SDK development tool, Game Coder which is a new iOS app that allows you to build a game on your iPad. Ricardo explained how projects can be exported to Corona for editing and then published for iOS devices. Itâ€™s an amazing tool that was built using Corona SDK. <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/game-coder/id580568570?ls=1&mt=8 target="_blank">Check out Game Coder</a> in the App Store! I&#8217;ll be posting the full interview with Ricardo in next few days along with a blog post that explains how Game Coder works. </p>
<p>Also this week, we&#8217;ve been reaching out to Corona Ambassadors around the world to get their feedback on the program. The ambassadors have been providing us with fantastic feedback about their goals for 2013 and we have begun working to create brand new resources so they can share Corona SDK with everyone they meet. If you missed the new <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiPuo5fIuZ0 target="_blank">Introduction to Corona SDK video</a>, be sure to watch it. It&#8217;s 7 minutes of focused information to help anyone get started using Corona.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday I&#8217;ll be heading back out to San Francisco for Apps World North America. Walter Luh and David Rangel are speaking at the event in two separate sessions. We&#8217;ll also have a booth at the event and members of the team will be hanging out at Apps World. I&#8217;ll be walking the event floor to talk with developers. Expect to see lots of pictures from the event. We&#8217;ll try to post as much video as possible, but battery life and internet might be limited.</p>
<p>On Monday, be sure to <a href=https://plus.google.com/events/c7tr9lkqh36nsntjmvb3jkafi0s target="_blank">join us on the weekly Corona Geek hangout</a> when we&#8217;ll be recapping Global Game Jam events and talking with the team at Esoteric Software about their <a href=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/esotericsoftware/spine target="_blank">wildly successful Kickstarter campaign</a> that has raised almost $17K. Their 2D skeletal animation tool is going to support Corona SDK, so we want to talk to them about that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this week.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to <a href=http://coronapaper.com/ target="_blank">download your FREE copy of Corona Paper</a>. Hurry though, because it&#8217;s only free through Monday, Feb. 4th. It&#8217;s a great magazine dedicated to mobile development using Corona SDK.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend.</p>

So yesterday&#8217;s launch of Global Game Jam here in San Francisco went well. </p>
<p>As people arrived they were encouraged to <a href=https://plus.google.com/108159899655420864045/posts/2pmHoY7ZUDa target="_blank">create fun hats to wear</a>. That helped to bring people together at the various tables around the room. Most people put their name on their hat as a form of name tag. </p>
<p>Overall, it was really just a time for people to get to know each other and talk because some people knew each other, but a lot of them didn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>So at first there was a lot of talking and buzz, but once the event organizer revealed the game jam theme and covered the guidlines, people began to team up to discuss game ideas. </p>
<p>Each team started out by creating a list of possible game concepts, which were expressed in just a few words each. Then once they had chosen a which concept they would adopt, based on team skills and time limits, they started talking details. </p>
<p>With <strike>46</strike> 28ish hours left to go, it will be interesting to see what they create.</p>
<p>Read the full recap of last night&#8217;s Global Game Jam events on the <a href=https://plus.google.com/108159899655420864045/posts/5v7PPh2zFZG target="_blank">Corona Geek Google+ page</a>.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t have a chance to <a href=http://globalgamejam.org/ target="_blank">attend one of this year&#8217;s events</a>, you should definitely consider putting it on your calendar for next year. It&#8217;s a lot of fun!</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Geek Speak</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ShaqDown &#038; Hiptic Games</strong> &#8211; This week we hung out with George Deglin and Long Vo from <a href=http://hiptic.com/ target="_blank">Hiptic Games</a> to talk about their new hit title, <a href=http://shaqdown.com/ target="_blank">ShaqDown</a>. George and Long are also the creators of <a href=http://goninjagame.com/ target="_blank">GoNinja</a>, which is one of my favorite mobile games. The guys shared how they were able to create a completely custom designed mobile app in just 11 weeks using Corona SDK. They also shared some behind the scenes secrets on how they got exposure for their app. One of the most interesting comments from Long was how they offered exclusive debut coverage to IGN Entertainment who has delivered my than <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKApL3YAnfA target="_blank">160K+ video views of their game trailer</a>. Combine that with their own push notification efforts through their existing GoNinja install base and you&#8217;re talking about a respectable amount of exposure for a brand new game.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Super Starter Kit (SSK) for Corona SDK</strong> &#8211; We also got the chance to talk with Ed Maurina, creator of <a href=http://roaminggamer.com/sskcorona/ target="_blank">SSKCorona</a>. Ed has created a third party Corona SDK library that helps developers create games and apps. The library grew out of Ed&#8217;s own usage needs and is now offered up to developers as a way to shortcut common app development tasks. The library is written in Lua and can be downloaded and modified to match your project requirements. Find more information about SSKCorona on <a href=https://github.com/roaminggamer/SSKCorona target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href=http://roaminggamer.com/sskcorona/ target="_blank">Roaming Gamer</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There won&#8217;t be a live Corona Geek hangout next week because I&#8217;ll be flying back from the <a href=http://globalgamejam.org/ target="_blank">Global Gam Jam</a> event in San Francisco. However, be sure to look for video updates and live blogging from the event. I&#8217;ll post as much as possible through out the entire 48 hour event.</li>

<p>After the Mobile Introduction to Corona webinar today, someone emailed me to ask if the Corona SDK was only for developing game apps. </p>
<p>As an outside observer who is new to Corona, here&#8217;s my opinion on the subject.</p>
<p>I think gaming is a big topic for mobile developers and Corona does a lot of heavy lifting for the developer in that space. That said, all the elements for creating non-game apps is there in the API. Depending on what someone is trying to do, there may be some things missing. It would be nearly impossible for to include support for everything that someone might want to do. But, overall <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2012/02/14/reading-and-writing-files-in-corona/ target="_blank">reading and writing files</a>, <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2012/04/03/tutorial-database-access-in-corona/ target="_blank">database management</a>, <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2011/08/03/tutorial-exploring-json-usage-in-corona/ target="_blank">XML file management using JSON</a>, networking, <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2011/12/21/push-notifications-for-ios-in-corona-sdk/ target="_blank">push notification</a>, etc. are there to build other non-game apps.</p>
<p>So I think the real question is, what do you want Corona to do for you?</p>
