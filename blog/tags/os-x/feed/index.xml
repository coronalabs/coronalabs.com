				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-66661" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alpha-omegaIcon-150x150.png" alt="alpha-omegaIcon" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alpha-omegaIcon-150x150.png 150w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alpha-omegaIcon.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />As a programmer, spelling isn&#8217;t my greatest strength, but I&#8217;m one of those people who can look at a jumbled-up word and actually read it. In fact, many people can decipher words as long as the first and last letters are correct and it&#8217;s the proper length.</p>
<p>For example, can you read this?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;<em>it deosn&#8217;t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>What started as an urban legend and Internet meme seems to actually have some facts and a term behind it: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia target="_blank">typoglycemia</a>.<b> </b></p>
<p>Leave it to an enterprising game shop to turn this phenomenon into a compelling game. <a href=http://borderleap.com/ target="_blank">BorderLeap</a>, a small studio founded by Nate Dicken, took this concept and put together <a href=http://playalphaomega.com/ target="_blank"><em>Alpha Omega</em></a>. Originally released for the &#8220;small screen&#8221; in April 2014, BorderLeap recently released the game for OS X desktop.</p>
<p>Since then, <em>Alpha Omega</em> has reached the #1 featured position across 150+ countries. It has also been the #1 paid &#8220;Puzzle&#8221; and #1 paid &#8220;Word&#8221; game, and it currently boasts accolades as the #2 overall paid game and #3 grossing game in the Mac App Store. As if that&#8217;s not enough, Apple featured <em>Alpha Omega</em> with a large banner in the &#8220;Word&#8221; game subcategory and also featured it in the &#8220;All Time Greats&#8221; in the same category.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuvSOzmFgzw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Want to see what the buzz is all about and test your skills at unscrambling jumbled words? <em>Alpha Omega</em> is available for <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alpha-omega/id748048441?mt=8>iOS</a>, <a href=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.borderleap.alphaomega>Google Play</a>, and <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alpha-omega/id1053559774?mt=12>OS X</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holiday season is upon us and once again the Corona engineering team is in a festive mood. This season they have been hard at work giving us some exciting new features and platforms to explore.</p>
<h3>OS X initial release</h3>
<p>As of <a href=https://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/daily-builds/ target="_blank">Daily Build 2015.2795</a>, we are proud to announce that OS X is no longer in beta! We have the core features working at a level where we feel comfortable encouraging you to release apps to the Mac App store. Platforms like this are never complete and there are more features to add, but this marks a stable point in OS X development where we think you can successfully deploy desktop apps for Mac. To learn more, see our <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/guide/distribution/osxBuild/index.html target="_blank">Creating OS X Desktop Apps</a> guide.</p>
<h3>tvOS now in beta</h3>
<p>Additionally, we are removing the &#8220;alpha&#8221; label from our <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/guide/tvos/index.html target="_blank">tvOS support</a>. We believe that you should be able to publish apps to iTunes Connect for tvOS. Of course there is more to do before we can mark this as fully released, but the core features are now in place. You can pick this up in <a href=https://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/daily-builds/ target="_blank">Daily Build 2015.2795</a> as well. To learn more, check out our <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/guide/tvos/index.html target="_blank">Apple TV and tvOS guide</a>.</p>
<h3>The iCloud plugin (beta)</h3>
<p>We are also pleased to announce the immediate availability of the new <a href=https://store.coronalabs.com/plugin/iCloud target="_blank">iCloud plugin</a>. This plugin lets you store various data types in Apple&#8217;s iCloud service. The three main types of data you can store are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key-Value Storage</strong> &#8212; This lets you store simple data values like numbers, strings, and tables.</li>
<li><strong>Documents</strong> &#8212; This lets you develop apps where you can save whole files to the cloud and sync them with other devices.</li>
<li><strong>CloudKit</strong> &#8212; This is a full database implementation where you can have public and private database implementations which your app can access from multiple devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>In its simplest use, iCloud (all three methods) lets you save data from your app to iCloud and retrieve it later when you need it. In addition, if you have your app installed on multiple devices, for example your iPhone and iPad, the app can share data.</p>
<p>To get started with the <a href=https://store.coronalabs.com/plugin/iCloud target="_blank">iCloud plugin</a>, see the <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/plugin/iCloud/index.html target="_blank">documentation</a> and our <a href=/blog/2015/12/18/tutorial-implementing-icloud-key-value-storage/ target="_blank">first tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3>Get started!</h3>
<p>With this progress on both OS X desktop builds and tvOS builds, now is a great time to consider additional platforms for your existing apps!</p>
