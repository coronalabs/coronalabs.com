<h3>The release of Coronium LS beta</h3>
<p>It’s great to watch an idea go from kernel to popcorn. <strong>Develephant’s</strong> Coronium has always been a boon to those of us who need a Lua-based server solution. It makes it easy for new Corona users to get started, while still being robust enough for those who are well versed in back-end server options.</p>
<p>Now, the most recent beta development in Coronium-land is out in the wild. <a href=https://coronium.cloud/ target="_blank">Coronium LS</a>, which has been covered previously in <em>From the Forum</em>, can be freely downloaded and utilized by anyone looking to get their feet wet with this great server-side Lua development option. While it’s still in beta, other developers are already attesting to its strengths and quick startup time.</p>
<p>Click through to the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/64759-release-coronium-ls-v100-beta/ target="_blank">original thread</a> for more information. Remember, new questions deserve new threads!</p>
<h3>Creating keystores for Android</h3>
<p>When first starting out, the methods necessary to build and deliver an app to the Google Play store seem a bit Byzantine. One particular step that seems to cause a lot of confusion is the generation of the keystore encryption.</p>
<p>The purpose here is to ensure that your app isn’t being spoofed for nefarious purposes while putting your personal stamp on the encryption key. It’s definitely not the most user-friendly set of steps available, but they are definitely necessary if you plan on publishing for the Google Play store. The <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/64772-keytool-to-bulid-release/ target="_blank">original thread</a> goes over the main steps and the pitfalls that you might encounter when creating your keystore.</p>
<h3>The age-old question of game marketing</h3>
<p>Interest in gaming keeps growing with no signs of waning. Consequently, eager developers fall in love with the combination of versatility and the low entry barrier that Corona offers.</p>
<p>Eventually, these developers have their games all polished up, server maintenance done, localization checked, and in-app purchases all sewn up. Then, the challenging part comes: making people aware of the app, and making them want to download it!</p>
<p>This <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/64768-game-marketing-best-practices/ target="_blank">forum thread</a> talks about some of the best ways to go about getting attention as a new developer without a publishing contract. Check them out for yourself and, if you have any tips of your own, feel free to throw them on the pile!</p>

<h3>Saving in the crypt</h3>
<p>We all value security. Whether you’re looking for a quality deadbolt for your home’s front door or a solid solution to app data, it never hurts to know all the latest security trends.</p>
<p>It is and will remain my fervent opinion that obfuscation is the only profitable method to secure data. I was extremely pleased to see a thread pop up that not only discussed methods for saving app data, but contained a cool snippet of code that demonstrated how to encrypt the data one would be saving.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63717-creating-a-save-function/ target="_blank">original thread here</a>, and don’t forget to say thanks!</p>
<h3>Await the loading screen!</h3>
<p>I always like to have a coroutine method in my back pocket. Nothing major for the most part: just something graphical to let my users know that the app hasn’t gone &#8220;kablooie&#8221; on them &#8212; instead, it&#8217;s just chugging through some data or retrieving an asset from a server.</p>
<p>Not everyone has a back-up plan for this kind of issue, so I wanted to share a thread where stellar Corona support engineer Rob Miracle talks about several different ways one can invent and implement a loading dialog. No need to make a separate scene if it doesn’t make sense for your app’s workflow &#8212; a simple overlay should do the trick!</p>
<p>Click through to the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63654-loading-system/ target="_blank">original thread</a> to find this illuminating discussion!</p>
<h3>Leaving a smoky trail</h3>
<p>One of the more interesting and dynamic effects in a physics-based game is representing a trail or &#8220;tail&#8221; of a projectile. Throwing a baseball, hitting a golf ball, tossing a javelin &#8212; all of these become more complex when coupled with this interesting articulation.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that you can’t have fun modifying the code contained in the original thread below to suit your needs! The sky&#8217;s the limit with this base snippet at your disposal: a snake-style game, trailing columns of smoke, maybe some particle details. Have an improvement or addition? Let us know <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63495-smoke-trails target="_blank">in the thread</a>.</p>
