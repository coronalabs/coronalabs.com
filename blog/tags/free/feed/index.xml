				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, to coincide with GDC, we&#8217;re making some very exciting announcements!</p>
<h3>Corona SDK is completely FREE</h3>
<p><a href=/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/free.png><img src=/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/free.png alt="free" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-61628" /></a>First, Corona SDK is now <a href=/pricing target="_blank">completely free</a>! Starting today, anyone who registers on our site will get the full power of Corona SDK (existing users can just logout and then re-login to the Corona Simulator).</p>
<p>Previously, you had to pay to get access to things like daily builds, in-app purchases, premium graphics, Pro-tier plugins, Windows Phone 8, etc. — now, everyone will get those for free. If you&#8217;re familiar with the old subscription tiers for Corona SDK (Starter, Basic, and Pro), everyone will now get the functionality that was available in Pro. There is now a single &#8220;Corona SDK&#8221; — one tier to rule them all.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Corona Enterprise, CoronaCards iOS, and CoronaCards Android will continue to be paid products.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an <strong>existing subscriber</strong> — Basic, Pro, or Enterprise — see <a href="#Subscriber-Upgrades">Free Upgrades for Subscribers</a> at the bottom of this post to learn about some great upgrades.</p>
<h3>Mac App and Win32 App support</h3>
<p><a href=/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mac-Win.png><img src=/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mac-Win.png alt="Mac+Win" width="168" height="76" class="alignright size-full wp-image-61620" /></a>In my <a href=/blog/2015/01/30/state-of-corona-thoughts-and-reflections-2015/>State of Corona</a> address, I mentioned new platforms as a major theme for 2015 and our strategy to make it happen.</p>
<p>And that brings us to our second major announcement: We are bringing Mac App and Win32 App support to the Corona platform!</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right.</p>
<p>We are going to make it incredibly easy for you to create apps that run everywhere — from desktop computers to mobile devices!</p>
<p>Currently, we are in the early stages. Our next milestone is to be able to package this up into a form that can be shared in a beta. More on this soon.</p>
<p>But we have some demos: come by the Fuse Powered/Corona Labs booth at the GDC Expo (Booth 1244, South Hall) this week if you&#8217;d like to see a few really great Corona apps running on desktop computers — as apps! We&#8217;ll also publish some videos of these here on the blog very soon.</p>
<h3>Fuse Powered monetization</h3>
<p><a href=/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/treasure-chest.jpg><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/treasure-chest-300x188.jpg" alt="treasure-chest" width="300" height="188" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-61622" /></a>Finally, our parent company, <a href=http://fusepowered.com/>Fuse Powered</a>, is taking monetization to a whole new level with a its player-centric monetization engine. See some <a href=http://venturebeat.com/2015/02/24/fuse-powered-launches-player-centric-mobile-monetization-engine/ target="_blank">recent coverage in VentureBeat</a>.</p>
<p>With this engine, you&#8217;ll be able to do 3 things. First, you&#8217;ll be able to analyze your players, and make meaningful conclusions from their in-game behavior. Next, you&#8217;ll be able to segment them based on these behaviors and figure out the most relevant offer to show them. Finally, you&#8217;ll be able to deliver targeted IAP offers, dynamic rewarded video, and ads.</p>
<p>On top of it all, you&#8217;ll also be able to mediate your own ad networks and leverage AdRally, Fuse’s competitive ad marketplace.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing on the market like this today, and it all translates into helping you make significantly more money!</p>
<p>While select Corona developers are already in private beta with Fuse Powered, we are working hard to nail down all the moving parts — there are a lot of them. Rest assured, we want to get this into your hands as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn more, come to Jon&#8217;s session at GDC on Tuesday, Mar 3: <a href=http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/player-centric-live-ops-monetization-presented-by-fuse-powered-inc>Player Centric Live Ops Monetization</a>.</p>
<p>Or come by the Fuse Powered/Corona Labs booth at the GDC Expo (Booth 1244, South Hall).</p>
<p><a name="Subscriber-Upgrades"></a></p>
<h3>Free Upgrades for Subscribers</h3>
<p>Now that Corona is free, we do realize there are many of you that have bought/renewed your Corona subscriptions recently and we want to make sure we take care of you. If you were an existing Basic, Pro, or Enterprise customer as of this morning, we&#8217;re going to give you some amazing, free upgrades:</p>
<ol>
<li>Current Corona Enterprise customers get CoronaCards iOS and CoronaCards Android licenses (1 month for each month you have left).</li>
<li>Current Corona SDK Pro customers have been upgraded to Corona Enterprise (1.5 months for each month you have left) and will also get CoronaCards iOS/Android.</li>
<li>Current Basic customers have been upgraded to Corona Enterprise (1 month for each month you have left) and will also get CoronaCards iOS/Android.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these upgrades should be in place NOW, but it&#8217;s possible some of you may have to wait a day or so to see the full upgrade.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re a Basic or Pro customer <strong>who bought in 2015 (Jan 1, 2015 or after)</strong>, and you do <strong>not</strong> want these upgrades, you can request a <em>pro-rated</em> refund. Email us at refund@coronalabs.com by Mar 15, 2015 11:59pm PST. If you meet the conditions, we will issue a refund within a few days.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please review <a href=/frequently-asked-questions/?#what-does-it-mean-that-corona-sdk-is-now-free>the FAQs</a>. If you still have questions or want to discuss, feel free to post in <a href=http://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/54933-corona-sdk-is-now-free/>this thread in the forum</a> and we will do our best to make it all clear!</p>
<hr />
<p>We are super excited about making Corona SDK free and opening it up to an even bigger worldwide developer community. This, together with our expanded platform coverage and the work we are doing with Fuse Powered is making for the start of a great year!</p>
<p>And, as always, we want to thank all our developers for using Corona and for making some amazing things with the Corona platform!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Today, we have some very exciting news. A new public release, a new version of Corona and a few other changes and coming features.

We are making mobile app development more accessible than ever!

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: Graphics 2.0 is now in public beta for all Corona SDK Pro and Enterprise subscribers.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Today, I have some very exciting news.</p>
<p>Before I dive in, let me talk about the new public release we just made available for <a href=https://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/corona-sdk>download</a>. We&#8217;ve been fixing a lot of plumbing this time around. Lots of infrastructure and feature improvements like a rewritten async http network library, a re-architected widget library, remote push notifications on Android, iAds, to name a few. We also have a new build server that&#8217;s much more scalable.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s tons more listed on the <a href=https://developer.coronalabs.com/content/corona-sdk-release-notes-build-2013-1076>release notes</a>. All in all, there&#8217;s been an incredible amount of work to make <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/>cross-platform development</a> as painless as possible. By the way, if you&#8217;re curious about Apple&#8217;s May 1 deadline on UDIDs, we&#8217;ve got you covered. Read more about it in the release notes.</p>

<h3>Introducing Corona SDK Starter</h3>
<p>Okay, so here&#8217;s where it gets really exciting. From very early on, we have focused on democratizing app development. We felt (and still do) that anyone could create the next great app with Corona. Since then, Corona has been embraced by indies and your apps have hit the top of the charts.</p>
<p>Indies are a key part of our community, so today, we are taking that vision a step further. We are announcing Corona SDK Starter &#8211; a completely FREE version of Corona that lets you publish to all the platforms we support without paying us a single cent.</p>
<p>With Corona SDK Starter and the Starter tier of Corona Cloud, you can publish amazing, connected apps faster and more affordably (free!) than ever before. We are the only platform that lets developers do this. A lot of other products have hidden fees or force some sort of watermark/splash screen. There is no such restriction with Starter. That&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;fake free&#8221; and a true free option.</p>
<p>Now, of course, not everything is free — we&#8217;ve got a business to run after all!</p>
<p>If you want to access certain specific features like in-app purchase and analytics, you&#8217;ll need to subscribe to a paid plan. You can still build with those features on your own device, but you can&#8217;t publish apps to the store if they use those premium features. Daily builds are also only available to paying subscribers.</p>
<h3>Re-imagining Pro</h3>
<p>From the beginning, Corona SDK has been about packaging up industry-standard technologies that big game studios use and making them available to you. The same underlying architecture that powered all the original top apps (Angry Birds, Tap Tap Revenge, Diner Dash) was the inspiration for Corona — only we made it 10x faster and easier.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why nothing beats Corona when it comes to its combination of power and speed of development.</p>
<p>Today, we are ready for the next growth spurt of innovation. We think Corona is the best platform in the universe, but the true measure is if we can make our latest innovations available to Pro subscribers.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do. We are going to make some amazing technologies available to all paying subscribers, but especially Pro. Here&#8217;s a glimpse at some of the exciting things that we&#8217;ll be making available:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/imagine-300x187.png" alt="imagine" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-31200" /></p>
<h4><strong>Graphics</strong></h4>
<p>As I talked about last week, our bleeding-edge OpenGL-ES 2.0/shader-based graphics engine is in the works. You are going to be blown away with what you can do. I&#8217;ll talk about that more later but I did want to give you a teaser.</p>
<p>If you watch this week&#8217;s <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPu2EZJTZBM>CoronaGeek episode</a>, you&#8217;ll be able to see 5,000 fish running at 60 fps! It may be hard to tell from the video, but this is what I showed to a lucky few at GDC. I recommend watching the whole show, but if you&#8217;re pressed for time, you can skip to roughly the 35:00 mark.</p>
<h4><strong>Plugins</strong></h4>
<p>Second, there&#8217;s Project Gluon, a.k.a plugins. We&#8217;ve done a ton of plumbing work so that you&#8217;ll be able to integrate 3rd party services and functionality into your app, and do so painlessly from the comfort of the Corona Simulator.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s good news and bad news here. There are a lot of moving parts, so plugins didn&#8217;t quite make it to the public release — and yes, I&#8217;m disappointed too.</p>
<p>But the good news is that plugins are coming very soon! We&#8217;re getting ready to seed this to beta testers this month. We are actively building a library of plugins that will be hosted on our servers. We&#8217;re working with folks like Amazon to get you more monetization options. We are acutely aware that this is a big issue for a lot of you.</p>
<h4><strong>Device Access</strong></h4>
<p>Lastly (for now), we have found a way for you to access certain Java and Objective-C APIs from Lua! On the Android side, we already have the foundation there thanks to Enterprise, and we&#8217;re looking at how we can accelerate bringing those Enterprise innovations down to Pro developers. In parallel, we also have a proof-of-concept on the iOS side, so I&#8217;ll have more news once we&#8217;re past the research phase.</p>
<h3>New Pro Pricing and Subscriber Promotions</h3>
<p>As you can see, we are re-imagining Pro as a much more sophisticated product. By May, we anticipate that the daily builds available to Pro will offer significantly more value than they do today. Because of that, we will be changing the price of Pro to $599/year starting May 1. Even after this change, we think Pro still remains a great bargain &#8211; it&#8217;s less than $50 per month and saves you hours of development work each and every day. And more importantly, you&#8217;ll be able to do more and more!</p>
<p>In the mean time, we want to thank our current subscribers and do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All current Indie subscribers are now upgraded to Pro (the Indie subscription has ceased to exist). </li>
<li>All current Pro subscribers now have an extra 2 months added on to their subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we are offering a special promotion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between now and April 30, anyone can <a href="https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/
">buy a Pro subscription</a> (or add to their existing subscription) for $349 before the new price takes effect.</li>
<li>But wait there&#8217;s more. As long as you have an active subscription on May 1, you will be able to renew at the $349/year price for 2 more years — just don&#8217;t let your subscription lapse!</li>
</ul>
<p>For more info, please refer to our <a href=/faq/>Corona SDK Pricing FAQs</a>.</p>
<p><center>* * *</center></p>
<p>Before I wrap up, there is one more item worth mentioning: we&#8217;ve finally gotten around to putting Corona Enterprise on our <a href="https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/
">store page</a>. If you are a small outfit, you qualify for the $999/year tier. Larger organizations can get Enterprise at $2499/year which comes with extra goodies and volume discounts. Check out our <a href="https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/
">entire pricing lineup</a> to see which one makes the most sense for you.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of game changing stuff here, but Corona SDK Starter brings me back to how we all got started — to change people&#8217;s lives in real ways. We think more people will have the opportunity to be a part of the mobile revolution and take advantage of the mobile revolution. We can&#8217;t wait to get all of our innovations into your hands – and more importantly, see what you do with them.</p>
