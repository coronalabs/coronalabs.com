				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The splash screen design contest voting results are now officially in! We thought you might be interested in the final rankings.</p>
<h3>Overall rankings</h3>
<p>As you can see by the pie chart below, the voting results varied greatly. While a few entries received concentrated votes, most votes were widely spread out.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-68463" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Corona_Splash_Screen_Contest_Voting_Results.png" alt="Corona Splash Screen Contest Voting Results" width="600" height="331" /></p>
<p>Overall we received <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B2cl4DNwwK2UVExjdC02STgyLXM target="_blank">91 total design submissions</a> from 21 individuals. Some contestants submitted only one design entry, while others contributed over 25 entries at one time. In the end, 171 total contest votes were cast.</p>
<p>Here is a quick breakdown of the community’s top design picks, along with prizes to be awarded in order of ranking:</p>
<h4>1st place</h4>
<p>11 votes were cast for entry #01, submitted by veteran plugin author Scott Harrison.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div>
<div id="attachment_68464" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-68464 size-full" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/01.jpg" alt="Contest entry #01" width="600" height="256" /><p class="wp-caption-text">11 votes (7.9%) for entry #01 by Scott Harrison</p></div>
<p>Scott will receive an embroidered Corona backpack and a license for the Splash Screen Control plugin.</p>
<h4>2nd place</h4>
<p>The 2nd place entry had 10 votes. This entry was submitted by Bram Vanbilsen.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div>
<div id="attachment_68465" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-68465 size-full" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/06-07.jpg" alt="Contest entry #06 - #07" width="600" height="534" /><p class="wp-caption-text">10 votes (7.1%) for entry #06 by Bram Vanbilsen, along with &#8220;light&#8221; version</p></div>
<p>Bram will receive a Corona t-shirt and a license for the Splash Screen Control plugin.</p>
<h4>3rd place</h4>
<p>Entry #10 received 8 votes and was submitted by self-taught animator and Corona ninja, Noah Malewicz.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"></div>
<div id="attachment_68466" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-68466 size-full" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-11.jpg" alt="Contest entry #10 - #11" width="600" height="400" /><p class="wp-caption-text">8 votes (5.7%) for entry #10 by Noah Malewicz, along with &#8220;light&#8221; version</p></div>
<p>Noah will receive a license for the Splash Screen Control plugin.</p>
<h4>Honorable Mention</h4>
<p>11 votes were also cast for entry #20, submitted by Corona veteran Jason Schroeder. His entry demos a Corona project with an animated version of the individual splash screen logo and text elements.</p>
<p>Since the submission fell outside the <a href=/blog/2016/09/20/splash-screen-contest-now-underway/ target="_blank">contest guidelines</a>, this entry will be awarded Honorable Mention. For his efforts, Jason will receive a license for the Splash Screen Control plugin.</p>

<h3>Moving forward</h3>
<p>We will continue to refine the splash screen, balancing changes with the goal of increasing Corona&#8217;s brand recognition. We will also continue to iterate and enhance the functionality of the Splash Screen Control plugin. It’s an important part of making people aware of all the great games and apps that have been created using Corona SDK.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the top entries! We want to sincerely thank everyone who submitted designs, cast a vote, and participated in the contest.</p>
