<h3>Saving in the crypt</h3>
<p>We all value security. Whether you’re looking for a quality deadbolt for your home’s front door or a solid solution to app data, it never hurts to know all the latest security trends.</p>
<p>It is and will remain my fervent opinion that obfuscation is the only profitable method to secure data. I was extremely pleased to see a thread pop up that not only discussed methods for saving app data, but contained a cool snippet of code that demonstrated how to encrypt the data one would be saving.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63717-creating-a-save-function/ target="_blank">original thread here</a>, and don’t forget to say thanks!</p>
<h3>Await the loading screen!</h3>
<p>I always like to have a coroutine method in my back pocket. Nothing major for the most part: just something graphical to let my users know that the app hasn’t gone &#8220;kablooie&#8221; on them &#8212; instead, it&#8217;s just chugging through some data or retrieving an asset from a server.</p>
<p>Not everyone has a back-up plan for this kind of issue, so I wanted to share a thread where stellar Corona support engineer Rob Miracle talks about several different ways one can invent and implement a loading dialog. No need to make a separate scene if it doesn’t make sense for your app’s workflow &#8212; a simple overlay should do the trick!</p>
<p>Click through to the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63654-loading-system/ target="_blank">original thread</a> to find this illuminating discussion!</p>
<h3>Leaving a smoky trail</h3>
<p>One of the more interesting and dynamic effects in a physics-based game is representing a trail or &#8220;tail&#8221; of a projectile. Throwing a baseball, hitting a golf ball, tossing a javelin &#8212; all of these become more complex when coupled with this interesting articulation.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that you can’t have fun modifying the code contained in the original thread below to suit your needs! The sky&#8217;s the limit with this base snippet at your disposal: a snake-style game, trailing columns of smoke, maybe some particle details. Have an improvement or addition? Let us know <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63495-smoke-trails target="_blank">in the thread</a>.</p>
