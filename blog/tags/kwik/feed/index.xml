				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-42486" alt="Zala icon" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-23-at-4.39.54-PM.png" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-23-at-4.39.54-PM.png 183w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-23-at-4.39.54-PM-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px" /></p>
<p>When a group of friends discover a secret treasure map, they need your help to decipher the map and embark on an adventure through the African savanna. Created for children ages 4-6, <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zala-and-the-treasure-cave/id682584983?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4>Zala and the Treasure Cave</a> captivates children’s senses — from touch to sound to sight — through vibrant illustrations, engaging elements to pull kids into the story, and an excellent mix of sounds and narration.</p>
<p>Zala and the Treasure Cave adds a new dimension to the idea of storytelling, combining an animated film with interactive games and puzzles that are woven into the story. The story-driven app uses the tools of film dramaturgy to transport emotions while integrating puzzles into the plot, while the games and a diverse cast of characters allow children to explore and discover app elements in a playful way.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s creators are a talented husband and wife duo who wanted to develop an educational eBook based on their own experiences growing up in Turkey and Germany. Their goal was to create a memorable story of friendship using characters of different colors, religions, and genders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-42487" alt="Zala screenshot" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Zala-screenshot.jpeg" /></p>
<p>While the creators had a solid background in filmmaking and 3D animation, they were new to the world of mobile development. They evaluated several tools and found that the majority were either too complicated to work with or too simple in their capabilities, especially when it came to straightforward integration of an interactive environment.</p>
<p>Within a few days of discovering Corona SDK, they learned the Lua programming language, analyzed Corona’s sample projects, and read <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/resources/tutorials/getting-started-with-corona/ target="_blank">Corona</a> and <a href=http://www.kwiksher.com/ target="_blank">Kwik</a> tutorials to get up to speed. In less than two weeks, they had a working prototype for testing on all devices, featuring audio integration, fade-in and fade-out between scenes, and much more.</p>
<p>To experience the striking graphics and high quality narration of <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zala-and-the-treasure-cave/id682584983?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4>Zala and the Treasure Cave</a>, head to iTunes and download the app for $2.99.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Xavier Bottet is the art director of Near Humanity, an upcoming series of horror comics for digital devices. Xavier and his partner Emmanuel Beaudry turned to Indiegogo to crowdfund their Corona SDK and Kwik-powered project. You can contribute to their campaign on the <a href=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/near-humanity-the-motion-comics/x/2914783?c=home>Near Humanity Indiegogo</a> page, and <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/id643325144?mt=8&s=143455>download NearHumanityNews</a>, the project&#8217;s teaser app, from Apple&#8217;s App Store.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-34597" alt="Near Humanity" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Near-Humanity-300x220.jpg" /></p>
<p>A few months ago, my partner and I put ourselves up to a challenge: to create a mature horror comic series with Corona SDK and <a href=http://www.kwiksher.com/>Kwik</a>. Today, that vision is called <em>Near Humanity</em>. I, Xavier Bottet, am an art director with game design experience, and my partner Emmanuel Beaudry is a writer with movie scripting experience.</p>
<p>Near Humanity blends horror stories, comics, animation, and interactive contents into one visceral experience. We&#8217;re still working on the project, but we plan to develop 12 full episodes, each lasting 5-7 minutes. I&#8217;m in charge of the technical aspects, while Emmanuel is responsible for the text definition.</p>
<p>Near Humanity’s core starts with the script, written by Emmanuel. After I view the script, we exchange ideas, make modifications, and then discuss the conceptual art. I then proceed to the illustration stage and mix in other media such as photos, scanned sketches, 3D elements, and digital paintings. Then I put all of the contents into Adobe After Effects. As the final step, Emmanuel edits the videos in Final Cut and &#8220;viola!&#8221;, we have an episode.</p>
<p>As with <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2012/10/29/app-of-the-week-halloween-recreation/>Halloween Recreation</a> — a 2012 App of the Week winner and my first Kwik and Corona SDK app — I prepare videos and present them to several &#8220;candidates&#8221; to see how they react to the app. Using Corona SDK and Kwik, we&#8217;ve also released NearHumanityNews, an app based around the entire campaign. We hope that this teaser app will help people discover our motion comics, peek at the official trailer, check out stills from the first episode, and maybe even discover some extra content.</p>
<p>We developed NearHumanityNews in just one week, and I used some video content from our <a href=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/near-humanity-the-motion-comics/x/2914783?c=home>crowdfunding</a> campaign. You can experience Near Humanity in a video, and then you interact with the same content in the app.</p>
<p>Our plan is to continue this project at full speed. Since we&#8217;re a small team — just the two of us, plus a few partners such as Melanie Jane, an English vocal artist who plays &#8220;Rachel&#8221; — we need to work as quickly and efficiently as possible. Recently, we discovered Indiegogo and set a flexible funding campaign which helped us to raise funds. Now, we&#8217;re reaching out to the Corona SDK community for help.</p>
<p>We hope that you enjoy NearHumanityNews as a free teaser, and that it inspires you to contribute to our cause, even in a small way. If funded, our motion comic will come to life, and we promise to deliver you more episodes soon. You can contribute to the <a href=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/near-humanity-the-motion-comics/x/2914783?c=home>Near Humanity Indiegogo</a> campaign and <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/id643325144?mt=8&s=143455>download NearHumanityNews</a> from the App Store. If you want to check out more videos, head to our <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_UyKkdJDREkdP20qGsJR6w>YouTube channel</a>.</p>
