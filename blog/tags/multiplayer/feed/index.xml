In <em>this series</em>, guest blogger Alex Jackson highlights outstanding threads from the <a href=http://forum.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Forum</a>. The goal is to bring attention to the most captivating, interesting, and thought-provoking discussions taking place in our very own backyard.</em></p>
<p><em>Please <a href=http://forum.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">visit the forum</a> to join these conversations or start your own!</em></p>

<h3>Multiplayer guides always come in handy</h3>
<p>It seems like with every rise of the morning sun, Corona developers have new multiplayer options to consider when developing their games. Fortunately, there are a few options that spring to the front and streamline the process while integrating nicely with Corona.</p>
<p>One of the more popular options is <a href=https://docs.coronalabs.com/plugin/photon/index.html target="_blank">Photon</a>, a robust multiplayer and networking platform which has a very strong presence in the Corona forums. In addition to easy integration, a Corona YouTuber has posted an incredibly useful video tutorial on creating a multiplayer game using the Photon engine at its core.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/64826-full-photon-game-video-tutorial/ target="_blank">original thread</a> to learn a bit more about this project, and if you have questions, don’t be shy!</p>
<h3>When “if-then” just isn’t enough</h3>
<p>Let’s paint a picture: you have multiple methods for handling different types of devices, app store delivery methods, or screen sizes. You want to maintain one code base, but still want to make sure that each new build contains the correct configurations associated with your stipulations. What’s the best way to accomplish this with the least amount of code?</p>
<p>Corona support engineer <strong>Rob Miracle</strong> chimed in on the thread below with some tips on setting up symbolic links (&#8220;symlinks&#8221;) on macOS machines. Valuable in other areas as well, symlinks can be worth their weight in gold.</p>
<p>Read the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/64905-conditional-assembly-for-differing-builds-in-numerous-countries target="_blank">original thread</a> to grab some tips on this process and how it can make a complicated project much simpler.</p>
<h3>Treading the familiar grounds of “scope”</h3>
<p><strong>Scope</strong> in Lua is a fickle beast. It can mystify new converts and conquer the most aged among us. Learning it is a requirement, but mastering it can take years.</p>
<p>Corona has many resources to help developers learn how scope works. Having a firm grasp of how scope relates to clean code and how it contributes to a solid project can be found in <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/64779-scope-forward-declarations-and-functions-and-functions-event-listeners-and-ordering/>this forum discussion</a>.</p>

Starting in Daily Build #1172, you can <a href="http://www.coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/">develop iOS games</a> that take full advantage of turn-based multiplayer features in Game Center.

We've built all these features into the 'gameNetwork' library so whether you have existing code or new code, it'll be a cinch to use. ]]></description>

You&#8217;re in luck!</p>
<p>Starting in Daily Build #1172, you can <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/>develop iOS games</a> that take full advantage of turn-based multiplayer features in Game Center.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve built all these features into the &#8216;gameNetwork&#8217; library so whether you have existing code or new code, it&#8217;ll be a cinch to use.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a full sample available: <a href=https://github.com/coronalabs/gameNetwork-iOS-turnbased-multiplayer>https://github.com/coronalabs/gameNetwork-iOS-turnbased-multiplayer</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick tour:</p>
<p>To invite players, you create a match with specific player id&#8217;s:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">gameNetwork.request( &quot;createMatch&quot;,
{
    playerIDs = {&quot;w4o98y3498hg349h&quot;, &quot;wrighfq547hg543&quot;},
    listener=requestCallback
})</pre><p></p>
<p>To auto-match players, you also create a match but you specify the number of players you want to match:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">gameNetwork.request( &quot;createMatch&quot;,
{
    minPlayers = 2,
    maxPlayers = 3,
    listener=requestCallback
})</pre><p></p>
<p>You can also mix and match, inviting some some players and then also auto match players to the same match:</p>
<p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">gameNetwork.request( &quot;createMatch&quot;,
{
    playerIDs = {&quot;w4o98y3498hg349h&quot;, &quot;wrighfq547hg543&quot;},
    minPlayers = 2,
    maxPlayers = 3,
    listener=requestCallback
})</pre><p></p>
<p>When the request listener is fired, the events contain a property &#8216;event.type&#8217; that takes on the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>invitationReceived </li>
<li>matchEnded </li>
<li>playerTurn</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the coolest thing is that notifications that tell you it&#8217;s your turn are automatic, so you don&#8217;t need to do anything!</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
<p>[Update] We also plan to add support for Game Center features added to iOS 6 such as invite messages, player attributes, and player groups.</p>
