		<description><![CDATA[Read further to learn about Forgotten Places: Regained Castle, an immersive adventure game with stunning artwork.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artwork can make or break a game. This is incredibly true for adventure games. For the developers at <a href=http://www.sungiftgames.com/ target="_blank">Sungift Games</a>, rocking the artwork is key to their games. Consider this week&#8217;s featured app <em><a href=http://www.sungiftgames.com/games/forgotten-places-regained-castle/ target="_blank">Forgotten Places: Regained Castle</a></em>:</p>
<p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z7zDWf0WfA8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Sungift Games was founded by Stas Dmytriiev and college friend Andriy Pertsov in 2009 as a self-funded indie game studio located in the Ukraine. They soon produced their first game, <a href=http://www.sungiftgames.com/games/forgotten-places-lost-circus/ target="_blank"><em>Forgotten Places: Lost Circus</em></a>, for PC and Mac. When they wanted to expand the game to other platforms as mobile gaming began to grow, they looked for an engine. They found Corona when it was still in beta and it took them just three months to port <em>Lost Circus</em> to mobile using the SDK. Fast forward to today and nine games later: their most recent game, <em><a href=http://www.sungiftgames.com/games/forgotten-places-regained-castle/ target="_blank">Forgotten Places: Regained Castle</a></em><em>,</em> is their largest and most complex game yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Lost Circus was quite successful, we raised the plank of quality we wanted to reach with the new game.&#8221; said Dmytriiev. &#8220;Corona is a great instrument and I doubt we would release our games without it. We tried other engines and SDKs like Moai, cocos-2dx, Marmalade, and Unity. They all have their pros and cons, but Corona excellently fits our needs and allows us to create games, not to struggle with technologies or platforms. We greatly appreciate the Corona team for this.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><a href=http://www.sungiftgames.com/games/forgotten-places-regained-castle/ target="_blank">Forgotten Places: Regained Castle</a></em> is the story of a young woman named Jane. Set in the early 20th century, her parents were killed in an accident in her childhood. A mysterious letter from her guardian who lives in an ancient castle brings her there to find answers. Your job is to guide Jane through this mystery and help break the curse of her clan.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-66832" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/forgottenplaces1-1024x576.jpg" alt="forgottenplaces1" width="960" height="540" /></p>
<p>As you traverse the 54 scenes covering 42 different locations, you will find incredibly detailed artwork which pulls you into this deep, rich, and challenging game. The game contains 21 mini-games and 14 puzzles along with 15 hidden object scenes to challenge you along the way. This is the kind of game that you can spend hours playing trying to solve the mystery. In fact, on <a href=http://www.wired.com/2016/03/amazon-underground-growth/ target="_blank">Amazon Underground</a> alone, the game has over 1 million minutes played. The game has also achieved a Top 100 ranking in the Games category in several countries and the Mac version is in the Top 50 in several countries. In all, over 75,000 people have downloaded the game.</p>

<p><em><a href=http://www.sungiftgames.com/games/forgotten-places-regained-castle/ target="_blank">Forgotten Places: Regained Castle</a></em> is currently available on Apple&#8217;s iTunes App Store and Mac App Store for $4.99 and on Google Play and Amazon for free with in-app purchases to unlock the entire game. Windows desktop and Windows Phone 8 versions are currently under development as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-66275" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blqvc8LmI3JaPAFkANVHAfF2aQ8JBiTaaNOQf_6zKh1VRFt0hDIw320KOSYYyVKJCAw300-150x150.png" alt="Blqvc8LmI3JaPAFkANVHAfF2aQ8JBiTaaNOQf_6zKh1VRFt0hDIw320KOSYYyVKJCA=w300" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blqvc8LmI3JaPAFkANVHAfF2aQ8JBiTaaNOQf_6zKh1VRFt0hDIw320KOSYYyVKJCAw300-150x150.png 150w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blqvc8LmI3JaPAFkANVHAfF2aQ8JBiTaaNOQf_6zKh1VRFt0hDIw320KOSYYyVKJCAw300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />This is a tale of two best friends since college: Graham Ransom the programmer and Simon Pearce the artist. Even though they went to different universities, both went on to study game development. They started <a href=http://www.glitchgames.co.uk/ target="_blank">Glitch Games</a> in January 2012 working on kids&#8217; educational titles. Within a month after they met, they took part in their first 48 hour game jam and tried to build an adventure game.</p>
<p>The result was  a title called <em>The Hauntening</em> which went on to win that game jam. They ended up releasing the game in the App Store for free to see if there was any interest in it. The feedback was positive and they began working on their first full-fledged adventure game. Eight months later, <em><a href=http://www.foreverlostgame.com/ target="_blank">Forever Lost</a>: Episode 1</em> was released for iOS and Android. Since then they have completed the trilogy and a free prequel game.</p>
<p><iframe width="1060" height="596" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9ethihZrMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Graham first discovered Corona SDK in 2009 when Corona was a fledgling framework. When he and Simon formed Glitch Games, it only made sense to continue using Corona SDK.</p>
<p>Having been around for a while, it&#8217;s safe to call Graham a pioneer in mobile adventure games and an early adopter of Corona Labs&#8217; technologies as they come out, including our recent desktop support. Not only is the full suite of games available on Apple&#8217;s App Store, Google Play, and Amazon, it&#8217;s also available on both OS X and Windows desktop. In addition, they have built their own adventure framework called Serenity which sits on top of Corona SDK and allows them to rapidly build adventure games.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-66276" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hnReR4Kbe1NXOQoHjVgZ60lbkNO1jJKYQPp3JWi0r1otpgKah5zw0873xgmUat_bL6ch900-1024x640.png" alt="hnReR4Kbe1NXOQoHjVgZ60lbkNO1jJKYQPp3JWi0r1otpgKah5zw0873xgmUat_bL6c=h900" width="960" height="600" /></p>
<p>When asked &#8220;Why Corona?&#8221; Graham said &#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for Corona, <em>Forever Lost</em> wouldn&#8217;t exist today. We&#8217;d most likely have to go get real jobs.&#8221;  With multiple-millions of downloads across all the the stores, Glitch games is one of the proverbial success stories for indie studios. <em>Forever Lost</em> has been #1 in multiple countries and it was short-listed for the TIGA awards a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Graham likes Corona for ease of development and quick iteration. Their first kids&#8217; apps were turned around in less than a month, while their full adventure games take around eight months to build. Graham&#8217;s advice to those new to app development? &#8220;Download Corona and start making a game!&#8221;</p>
