				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-67590" style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Logo-300x63.png" alt="Logo" width="240" height="50" />Whether you have sung &#8220;Do-Re-Mi&#8221; while watching a musical or learned to sing in music classes, you were practicing &#8220;scales.&#8221; Scales, or singing a series of notes in a particular order, is a common training practice for voice musicians.</p>
<p>Usually, practicing scales involves someone playing the notes on a piano or other instrument. While this might sound straightforward, carrying an instrument around isn&#8217;t always practical. Having an app to practice scales any time would be very helpful.</p>
<p>Understanding this need, Christian Savalas wanted to create the best voice training app for both iOS and Android. So, he built <a href=http://swiftscales.com/ target="_blank">SWIFTSCALES</a> using Corona SDK!</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxCWCTxQqnk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The app features an innovative and flexible design that allows the singer to use common scales or construct their own. Anyone, from a beginner to the most seasoned performer, can use the app to practice and warm up their voice.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-67591 size-large" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/iPad-3-768x1024.jpg" alt="iPad - 3" width="768" height="1024" /></p>
<p>SWIFTSCALES is available for free in both the App Store and Google Play. A $1.99 in-app purchase unlocks extended features and removes advertising in the app. This is a great example of a powerful utility app built with Corona SDK.</p>
<p><a href=https://itunes.apple.com/app/swiftscales-vocal-trainer/id1079277628 target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-64556" style="margin-right: 10px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/app-store-badge.png" alt="app-store-badge" width="50" height="50" /></a><a href=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swiftscales.music.vvt target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-64594" style="margin-right: 10px;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/google-play-badge.png" alt="google-play-badge" width="50" height="50" /></a></p>
<p>Corona SDK can be used to <a href=/corona-showcase/ target="_blank">develop countless great apps</a>. Imagine what you might build!</p>
