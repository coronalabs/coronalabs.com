				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/130327_ouya_0021.jpg><img src=http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/130327_ouya_0021.jpg alt="Ouya corona sdk" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-43820" /></a>Today, we are announcing our latest Public Release, 2013.1202. It&#8217;s immediately available for <a href=https://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/corona-sdk>download</a> for your <a href=/products/corona-sdk/>app development</a> pleasure!</p>
<p>There are a lots of improvements in the <a href=https://developer.coronalabs.com/content/corona-sdk-release-notes-build-2013-1202>release notes</a>, so I&#8217;ll just highlight a few.</p>
<p>First, we&#8217;ve added Ouya, GameStick, and NVIDIA Shield support. This includes support for game controllers and joysticks on those devices. We&#8217;ve also added general support for HID-based devices on Android, so you can connect your keyboard, mouse, and touchpad. If you have a MOGA Pro or a Sony PS3 controller, those are HID-based and work as well!</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the gaming theme, we&#8217;ve added real-time multiplayer support via Google Play game services on Android. And we&#8217;ve added turn-based multiplayer support via Game Center on iOS. We&#8217;ve also partnered with <a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2013/08/15/guest-piece-photon-cloud-corona-sdk-a-dream-team-for-cross-platform-multiplayer-games/>Photon Cloud</a> for real-time multiplayer support across iOS and Android.</p>
<p>For more business-oriented apps, we&#8217;ve added several features like left/center/right alignment to &#8216;display.newText&#8217;. We&#8217;ve also started to offer support for the iOS SocialKit framework. This is done via a plugin to the &#8216;native.showPopup&#8217; API that lets you post on Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo. We added Address Book popup as an iOS plugin as well.</p>
<p>On the monetization and services side, our roster of 3rd party plugins continues to grow:</p>
<p><a href=http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PastedGraphic-2.png><img src="http://www.coronalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PastedGraphic-2-216x300.png" alt="corona amplitude analytics" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-43818" /></a></p>
<p>* Google Game Play Services<br />
* Vungle<br />
* CrossInstall<br />
* AppRever<br />
* Pinsight Media+</p>
<p>Finally, the last thing I&#8217;ll highlight is we are upgrading our old analytics (a.k.a. LaunchPad) to <a href=https://amplitude.com/>Amplitude</a>. If you&#8217;ve ever played with other analytics services, one thing you know is that you can often wait a day or longer before you see data. As things scale up, you might experience a few hours delay, but Amplitude&#8217;s goal is to give you near real-time data!</p>
<p>As part of this upgrade, we&#8217;ve also cleaned up the web dashboard. We think it&#8217;s a lot more usable and the information is presented in a manner that will help you understand your customers a lot better. During the transition, the old dashboard will not display your data properly.</p>
<p>In terms of timing, the entire transition is happening right now, and we hope to have it completed by the end of September. The great thing is, you won&#8217;t have to do a thing to take advantage of the basic service â€” it&#8217;s free!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
