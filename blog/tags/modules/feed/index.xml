With that in mind, Corona Labs is partnering with Michael Wilson of <a href=http://ponywolf.com/ target="_blank">Ponywolf, LLC</a> to provide you with great projects to study and learn from.</p>
<p>The first project in the series is <strong>Match Three Space RPG</strong>, a simple &#8220;match three&#8221; style game with a classic sci-fi RPG theme.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to teach modular design and project organization while also providing reusable modules for your own apps.</p>
<p>The complete project is now available for free in the <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/asset/match-3-space-rpg target="_blank">Corona Marketplace</a>.  Or, if you wish to obtain the project directly, it&#8217;s available on <a href=https://github.com/coronalabs/Match-Three-Space-RPG target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLhE_IYaXVf9skwhKXNswj0C9U3RZB3DaD&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Once you download the project, open it in the Corona Simulator and play around with the game to learn its flow/gameplay. Then study the code to see how everything works and how you can use its reusable heart meter, health bar, score keeping, hallway, and other modules in your own games.</p>
<h3>Assets for all</h3>
<p>This project also represents our first <strong>downloadable asset</strong> in the <a href=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Marketplace</a>. In addition to this project, we&#8217;re currently getting several more asset providers on-boarded. While their assets won&#8217;t show up in the main directory for a little bit longer, you will be able to access them by direct link and download them as the asset landing pages become public.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Corona Labs is committed to providing an ever-increasing level of learning materials to help you get the most out of your Corona app development experience. Please join us in the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/forum/600-general-questionsdiscussion/ target="_blank">Corona Forums</a> to discuss this project and tell us how you are using it.</p>

In <em>this series</em>, guest blogger Alex Jackson highlights outstanding threads from the <a href=http://forum.coronalabs.com/ target="_blank">Corona Forum</a>.

<h3>When is running endlessly not really running?</h3>
<p>Starting out on the long road of game development means learning concepts that are not intuitive, even to programmers. Procedural generation, game loops, and asset management versus memory management are all concerns facing fledgling Corona enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The endless runner is a great project to get your feet wet in the world of Corona game development. However, though it seems simple on the candy-coated surface, things can get messy pretty quickly. Discussion on the anatomy of an endless runner came up in the forum recently <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/64465-is-endless-running-game-really-endless/ target="_blank">here</a>. It underlines some basic elements of game design which are useful no matter where you are in your development journey.</p>
<h3>Coronium LS</h3>
<p>We are all waiting with baited breath for the full release of Corona Labs&#8217; hosted solution which is being discussed in hushed whispers around campfires. While we wait, <strong>Develephant</strong> unleashed a community-supported option to the masses, <strong>Coronium LS</strong>. According to the man himself, it’s a “hybrid cloud solution for your Corona SDK games. A lot of ‘love’ went into this project, and I&#8217;m very excited to share it with you. Get your helmets on.”</p>
<p>Check out the <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/64464-new-coronium-ls-the-hybrid-cloud target="_blank">original thread</a> that points to the documentation and information on the project as a whole!</p>
<h3>When to use a module</h3>
<p>Continuing on the theme of game development, we have a fantastic conversation going on between a relatively new Corona developer and a couple of old-timers who have been around the block. Specifically, when do you use a module instead of simply including code in <code>main.lua</code> or whichever scene you are running? Check out <a href=https://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/63854-when-does-it-make-sense-to-employ-a-module-instead-of-a-function-within-a-scene-file/ target="_blank">the discussion</a> for a thorough dissertation on the finer points of modularized code, along with the basic tenets of &#8220;DRY&#8221; programming.</p>
